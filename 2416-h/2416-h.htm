<h2>THE HOUSE OF PRIDE</h2>
<p>Percival Ford wondered why he had come.&nbsp; He did not 
dance.&nbsp; He did not care much for army people.&nbsp; Yet he 
knew them all&mdash;gliding and revolving there on the broad 
<i>lanai</i> of the Seaside, the officers in their fresh-starched
uniforms of white, the civilians in white and black, and the 
women bare of shoulders and arms.&nbsp; After two years in 
Honolulu the Twentieth was departing to its new station in 
Alaska, and Percival Ford, as one of the big men of the Islands, 
could not help knowing the officers and their women.</p>
<p>But between knowing and liking was a vast gulf.&nbsp; The army
women frightened him just a little.&nbsp; They were in ways quite
different from the women he liked best&mdash;the elderly women, 
the spinsters and the bespectacled maidens, and the very serious 
women of all ages whom he met on church and library and 
kindergarten committees, who came meekly to him for contributions
and advice.&nbsp; He ruled those women by virtue of his superior 
mentality, his great wealth, and the high place he occupied in 
the commercial baronage of Hawaii.&nbsp; And he was not afraid of
them in the least.&nbsp; Sex, with them, was not obtrusive.&nbsp;
Yes, that was it.&nbsp; There was in them something else, or 
more, than the assertive grossness of life.&nbsp; He was 
fastidious; he acknowledged that to himself; and these army 
women, with their bare shoulders and naked arms, their 
straight-looking eyes, their vitality and challenging femaleness,
jarred upon his sensibilities.</p>
<p>Nor did he get on better with the army men, who took life 
lightly, drinking and smoking and swearing their way through life
and asserting the essential grossness of flesh no less 
shamelessly than their women.&nbsp; He was always uncomfortable 
in the company of the army men.&nbsp; They seemed uncomfortable, 
too.&nbsp; And he felt, always, that they were laughing at him up
their sleeves, or pitying him, or tolerating him.&nbsp; Then, 
too, they seemed, by mere contiguity, to emphasize a lack in him,
to call attention to that in them which he did not possess and 
which he thanked God he did not possess.&nbsp; Faugh!&nbsp; They 
were like their women!</p>
<p>In fact, Percival Ford was no more a woman&rsquo;s man than he
was a man&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; A glance at him told the 
reason.&nbsp; He had a good constitution, never was on intimate 
terms with sickness, nor even mild disorders; but he lacked 
vitality.&nbsp; His was a negative organism.&nbsp; No blood with 
a ferment in it could have nourished and shaped that long and 
narrow face, those thin lips, lean cheeks, and the small, sharp 
eyes.&nbsp; The thatch of hair, dust-coloured, straight and 
sparse, advertised the niggard soil, as did the nose, thin, 
delicately modelled, and just hinting the suggestion of a 
beak.&nbsp; His meagre blood had denied him much of life, and 
permitted him to be an extremist in one thing only, which thing 
was righteousness.&nbsp; Over right conduct he pondered and 
agonized, and that he should do right was as necessary to his 
nature as loving and being loved were necessary to commoner 
clay.</p>
<p>He was sitting under the algaroba trees between the 
<i>lanai</i> and the beach.&nbsp; His eyes wandered over the 
dancers and he turned his head away and gazed seaward across the 
mellow-sounding surf to the Southern Cross burning low on the 
horizon.&nbsp; He was irritated by the bare shoulders and arms of
the women.&nbsp; If he had a daughter he would never permit it, 
never.&nbsp; But his hypothesis was the sheerest 
abstraction.&nbsp; The thought process had been accompanied by no
inner vision of that daughter.&nbsp; He did not see a daughter 
with arms and shoulders.&nbsp; Instead, he smiled at the remote 
contingency of marriage.&nbsp; He was thirty-five, and, having 
had no personal experience of love, he looked upon it, not as 
mythical, but as bestial.&nbsp; Anybody could marry.&nbsp; The 
Japanese and Chinese coolies, toiling on the sugar plantations 
and in the rice-fields, married.&nbsp; They invariably married at
the first opportunity.&nbsp; It was because they were so low in 
the scale of life.&nbsp; There was nothing else for them to 
do.&nbsp; They were like the army men and women.&nbsp; But for 
him there were other and higher things.&nbsp; He was different 
from them&mdash;from all of them.&nbsp; He was proud of how he 
happened to be.&nbsp; He had come of no petty love-match.&nbsp; 
He had come of lofty conception of duty and of devotion to a 
cause.&nbsp; His father had not married for love.&nbsp; Love was 
a madness that had never perturbed Isaac Ford.&nbsp; When he 
answered the call to go to the heathen with the message of life, 
he had had no thought and no desire for marriage.&nbsp; In this 
they were alike, his father and he.&nbsp; But the Board of 
Missions was economical.&nbsp; With New England thrift it weighed
and measured and decided that married missionaries were less 
expensive per capita and more efficacious.&nbsp; So the Board 
commanded Isaac Ford to marry.&nbsp; Furthermore, it furnished 
him with a wife, another zealous soul with no thought of 
marriage, intent only on doing the Lord&rsquo;s work among the 
heathen.&nbsp; They saw each other for the first time in 
Boston.&nbsp; The Board brought them together, arranged 
everything, and by the end of the week they were married and 
started on the long voyage around the Horn.</p>
<p>Percival Ford was proud that he had come of such a 
union.&nbsp; He had been born high, and he thought of himself as 
a spiritual aristocrat.&nbsp; And he was proud of his 
father.&nbsp; It was a passion with him.&nbsp; The erect, austere
figure of Isaac Ford had burned itself upon his pride.&nbsp; On 
his desk was a miniature of that soldier of the Lord.&nbsp; In 
his bedroom hung the portrait of Isaac Ford, painted at the time 
when he had served under the Monarchy as prime minister.&nbsp; 
Not that Isaac Ford had coveted place and worldly wealth, but 
that, as prime minister, and, later, as banker, he had been of 
greater service to the missionary cause.&nbsp; The German crowd, 
and the English crowd, and all the rest of the trading crowd, had
sneered at Isaac Ford as a commercial soul-saver; but he, his 
son, knew different.&nbsp; When the natives, emerging abruptly 
from their feudal system, with no conception of the nature and 
significance of property in land, were letting their broad acres 
slip through their fingers, it was Isaac Ford who had stepped in 
between the trading crowd and its prey and taken possession of 
fat, vast holdings.&nbsp; Small wonder the trading crowd did not 
like his memory.&nbsp; But he had never looked upon his enormous 
wealth as his own.&nbsp; He had considered himself God&rsquo;s 
steward.&nbsp; Out of the revenues he had built schools, and 
hospitals, and churches.&nbsp; Nor was it his fault that sugar, 
after the slump, had paid forty per cent; that the bank he 
founded had prospered into a railroad; and that, among other 
things, fifty thousand acres of Oahu pasture land, which he had 
bought for a dollar an acre, grew eight tons of sugar to the acre
every eighteen months.&nbsp; No, in all truth, Isaac Ford was an 
heroic figure, fit, so Percival Ford thought privately, to stand 
beside the statue of Kamehameha I. in front of the Judiciary 
Building.&nbsp; Isaac Ford was gone, but he, his son, carried on 
the good work at least as inflexibly if not as masterfully.</p>
<p>He turned his eyes back to the <i>lanai</i>.&nbsp; What was 
the difference, he asked himself, between the shameless, 
grass-girdled <i>hula</i> dances and the decoll&eacute;t&eacute; 
dances of the women of his own race?&nbsp; Was there an essential
difference? or was it a matter of degree?</p>
<p>As he pondered the problem a hand rested on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ford, what are you doing here?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
this a bit festive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to be lenient, Dr. Kennedy, even as I look 
on,&rdquo; Percival Ford answered gravely.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kennedy sat down, clapping his palms sharply.&nbsp; A 
white-clad Japanese servant answered swiftly.</p>
<p>Scotch and soda was Kennedy&rsquo;s order; then, turning to 
the other, he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will take something,&rdquo; Ford said 
firmly.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s eyes showed surprise, and the 
servant waited.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boy, a lemonade, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor laughed at it heartily, as a joke on himself, and 
glanced at the musicians under the <i>hau</i> tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the Aloha Orchestra,&rdquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought they were with the Hawaiian Hotel on
Tuesday nights.&nbsp; Some rumpus, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes paused for a moment, and dwelt upon the one who was 
playing a guitar and singing a Hawaiian song to the accompaniment
of all the instruments.</p>
<p>His face became grave as he looked at the singer, and it was 
still grave as he turned it to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ford, isn&rsquo;t it time you let up on Joe 
Garland?&nbsp; I understand you are in opposition to the 
Promotion Committee&rsquo;s sending him to the States on this 
surf-board proposition, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to speak to 
you about it.&nbsp; I should have thought you&rsquo;d be glad to 
get him out of the country.&nbsp; It would be a good way to end 
your persecution of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persecution?&rdquo;&nbsp; Percival Ford&rsquo;s 
eyebrows lifted interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it by any name you please,&rdquo; Kennedy went 
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hounded that poor devil for 
years.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not his fault.&nbsp; Even you will admit 
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not his fault?&rdquo;&nbsp; Percival Ford&rsquo;s thin 
lips drew tightly together for the moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joe 
Garland is dissolute and idle.&nbsp; He has always been a 
wastrel, a profligate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no reason you should keep on after him
the way you do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve watched you from the 
beginning.&nbsp; The first thing you did when you returned from 
college and found him working on the plantation as outside 
<i>luna</i> was to fire him&mdash;you with your millions, and he 
with his sixty dollars a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the first thing,&rdquo; Percival Ford said 
judicially, in a tone he was accustomed to use in committee 
meetings.&nbsp; &ldquo;I gave him his warning.&nbsp; The 
superintendent said he was a capable <i>luna</i>.&nbsp; I had no 
objection to him on that ground.&nbsp; It was what he did outside
working hours.&nbsp; He undid my work faster than I could build 
it up.&nbsp; Of what use were the Sunday schools, the night 
schools, and the sewing classes, when in the evenings there was 
Joe Garland with his infernal and eternal tum-tumming of guitar 
and <i>ukulele</i>, his strong drink, and his <i>hula</i> 
dancing?&nbsp; After I warned him, I came upon him&mdash;I shall 
never forget it&mdash;came upon him, down at the cabins.&nbsp; It
was evening.&nbsp; I could hear the <i>hula</i> songs before I 
saw the scene.&nbsp; And when I did see it, there were the girls,
shameless in the moonlight and dancing&mdash;the girls upon whom 
I had worked to teach clean living and right conduct.&nbsp; And 
there were three girls there, I remember, just graduated from the
mission school.&nbsp; Of course I discharged Joe Garland.&nbsp; I
know it was the same at Hilo.&nbsp; People said I went out of my 
way when I persuaded Mason and Fitch to discharge him.&nbsp; But 
it was the missionaries who requested me to do so.&nbsp; He was 
undoing their work by his reprehensible example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards, when he got on the railroad, your railroad,
he was discharged without cause,&rdquo; Kennedy challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; was the quick answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
him into my private office and talked with him for half an 
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You discharged him for inefficiency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For immoral living, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kennedy laughed with a grating sound.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who the
devil gave it to you to be judge and jury?&nbsp; Does landlordism
give you control of the immortal souls of those that toil for 
you?&nbsp; I have been your physician.&nbsp; Am I to expect 
tomorrow your ukase that I give up Scotch and soda or your 
patronage?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; Ford, you take life too 
seriously.&nbsp; Besides, when Joe got into that smuggling scrape
(he wasn&rsquo;t in your employ, either), and he sent word to 
you, asked you to pay his fine, you left him to do his six 
months&rsquo; hard labour on the reef.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget, 
you left Joe Garland in the lurch that time.&nbsp; You threw him 
down, hard; and yet I remember the first day you came to 
school&mdash;we boarded, you were only a day scholar&mdash;you 
had to be initiated.&nbsp; Three times under in the swimming 
tank&mdash;you remember, it was the regular dose every new boy 
got.&nbsp; And you held back.&nbsp; You denied that you 
<i>could</i> swim.&nbsp; You were frightened, 
hysterical&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Percival Ford said slowly.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I was frightened.&nbsp; And it was a lie, for I could swim
. . . And I was frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you remember who fought for you? who lied for you 
harder than you could lie, and swore he knew you couldn&rsquo;t 
swim?&nbsp; Who jumped into the tank and pulled you out after the
first under and was nearly drowned for it by the other boys, who 
had discovered by that time that you <i>could</i> 
swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know,&rdquo; the other rejoined 
coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But a generous act as a boy does not excuse 
a lifetime of wrong living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never done wrong to you?&mdash;personally and 
directly, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Percival Ford&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That is what makes my position impregnable.&nbsp; I have 
no personal spite against him.&nbsp; He is bad, that is 
all.&nbsp; His life is bad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is another way of saying that he does not agree 
with you in the way life should be lived,&rdquo; the doctor 
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it that way.&nbsp; It is immaterial.&nbsp; He is 
an idler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With reason,&rdquo; was the interruption, 
&ldquo;considering the jobs out of which you have knocked 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is immoral&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hold on now, Ford.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go harping on 
that.&nbsp; You are pure New England stock.&nbsp; Joe Garland is 
half Kanaka.&nbsp; Your blood is thin.&nbsp; His is warm.&nbsp; 
Life is one thing to you, another thing to him.&nbsp; He laughs 
and sings and dances through life, genial, unselfish, childlike, 
everybody&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; You go through life like a 
perambulating prayer-wheel, a friend of nobody but the righteous,
and the righteous are those who agree with you as to what is 
right.&nbsp; And after all, who shall say?&nbsp; You live like an
anchorite.&nbsp; Joe Garland lives like a good fellow.&nbsp; Who 
has extracted the most from life?&nbsp; We are paid to live, you 
know.&nbsp; When the wages are too meagre we throw up the job, 
which is the cause, believe me, of all rational suicide.&nbsp; 
Joe Garland would starve to death on the wages you get from 
life.&nbsp; You see, he is made differently.&nbsp; So would you 
starve on his wages, which are singing, and 
love&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lust, if you will pardon me,&rdquo; was the 
interruption.</p>
<p>Dr. Kennedy smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, to you, is a word of four letters and a 
definition which you have extracted from the dictionary.&nbsp; 
But love, real love, dewy and palpitant and tender, you do not 
know.&nbsp; If God made you and me, and men and women, believe me
He made love, too.&nbsp; But to come back.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about
time you quit hounding Joe Garland.&nbsp; It is not worthy of 
you, and it is cowardly.&nbsp; The thing for you to do is to 
reach out and lend him a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I, any more than you?&rdquo; the other 
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you reach him a 
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m reaching him a hand now.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m trying to get you not to down the Promotion 
Committee&rsquo;s proposition of sending him away.&nbsp; I got 
him the job at Hilo with Mason and Fitch.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got 
him half a dozen jobs, out of every one of which you drove 
him.&nbsp; But never mind that.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget one 
thing&mdash;and a little frankness won&rsquo;t hurt you&mdash;it 
is not fair play to saddle another fault on Joe Garland; and you 
know that you, least of all, are the man to do it.&nbsp; Why, 
man, it&rsquo;s not good taste.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s positively 
indecent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; Percival Ford 
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re up in the air with some 
obscure scientific theory of heredity and personal 
irresponsibility.&nbsp; But how any theory can hold Joe Garland 
irresponsible for his wrongdoings and at the same time hold me 
personally responsible for them&mdash;more responsible than any 
one else, including Joe Garland&mdash;is beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of delicacy, I suppose, or of 
taste, that prevents you from following me,&rdquo; Dr. Kennedy 
snapped out.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well, for the sake 
of society, tacitly to ignore some things, but you do more than 
tacitly ignore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, pray, that I tacitly ignore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kennedy was angry.&nbsp; A deeper red than that of 
constitutional Scotch and soda suffused his face, as he 
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, man, you can&rsquo;t ask me to be plainer 
spoken than that.&nbsp; But if you will, all right&mdash;Isaac 
Ford&rsquo;s son&mdash;Joe Garland&mdash;your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percival Ford sat quietly, an annoyed and shocked expression 
on his face.&nbsp; Kennedy looked at him curiously, then, as the 
slow minutes dragged by, became embarrassed and frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried finally, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
mean to tell me that you didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As in answer, Percival Ford&rsquo;s cheeks turned slowly 
grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghastly joke,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a 
ghastly joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor had got himself in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
thought you knew it.&nbsp; And since you don&rsquo;t know it, 
it&rsquo;s time you did, and I&rsquo;m glad of the chance of 
setting you straight.&nbsp; Joe Garland and you are 
brothers&mdash;half-brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; Ford cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You 
don&rsquo;t mean it.&nbsp; Joe Garland&rsquo;s mother was Eliza 
Kunilio.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Dr. Kennedy nodded.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
remember her well, with her duck pond and <i>taro</i> 
patch.&nbsp; His father was Joseph Garland, the 
beach-comber.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Dr. Kennedy shook his head.)&nbsp; 
&ldquo;He died only two or three years ago.&nbsp; He used to get 
drunk.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s where Joe got his dissoluteness.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the heredity for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody told you,&rdquo; Kennedy said wonderingly, 
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Kennedy, you have said something terrible, which I 
cannot allow to pass.&nbsp; You must either prove or, or . . . 
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove it yourself.&nbsp; Turn around and look at 
him.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got him in profile.&nbsp; Look at his 
nose.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Isaac Ford&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Yours is a 
thin edition of it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Look.&nbsp; 
The lines are fuller, but they are all there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percival Ford looked at the Kanaka half-breed who played under
the <i>hau</i> tree, and it seemed, as by some illumination, that
he was gazing on a wraith of himself.&nbsp; Feature after feature
flashed up an unmistakable resemblance.&nbsp; Or, rather, it was 
he who was the wraith of that other full-muscled and generously 
moulded man.&nbsp; And his features, and that other man&rsquo;s 
features, were all reminiscent of Isaac Ford.&nbsp; And nobody 
had told him.&nbsp; Every line of Isaac Ford&rsquo;s face he 
knew.&nbsp; Miniatures, portraits, and photographs of his father 
were passing in review through his mind, and here and there, over
and again, in the face before him, he caught resemblances and 
vague hints of likeness.&nbsp; It was devil&rsquo;s work that 
could reproduce the austere features of Isaac Ford in the loose 
and sensuous features before him.&nbsp; Once, the man turned, and
for one flashing instant it seemed to Percival Ford that he saw 
his father, dead and gone, peering at him out of the face of Joe 
Garland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing at all,&rdquo; he could faintly hear
Dr. Kennedy saying, &ldquo;They were all mixed up in the old 
days.&nbsp; You know that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve seen it all your 
life.&nbsp; Sailors married queens and begat princesses and all 
the rest of it.&nbsp; It was the usual thing in the 
Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not with my father,&rdquo; Percival Ford 
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kennedy shrugged his 
shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cosmic sap and smoke of life.&nbsp; Old 
Isaac Ford was straitlaced and all the rest, and I know 
there&rsquo;s no explaining it, least of all to himself.&nbsp; He
understood it no more than you do.&nbsp; Smoke of life, 
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t forget one thing, 
Ford.&nbsp; There was a dab of unruly blood in old Isaac Ford, 
and Joe Garland inherited it&mdash;all of it, smoke of life and 
cosmic sap; while you inherited all of old Isaac&rsquo;s ascetic 
blood.&nbsp; And just because your blood is cold, well-ordered, 
and well-disciplined, is no reason that you should frown upon Joe
Garland.&nbsp; When Joe Garland undoes the work you do, remember 
that it is only old Isaac Ford on both sides, undoing with one 
hand what he does with the other.&nbsp; You are Isaac 
Ford&rsquo;s right hand, let us say; Joe Garland is his left 
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percival Ford made no answer, and in the silence Dr. Kennedy 
finished his forgotten Scotch and soda.&nbsp; From across the 
grounds an automobile hooted imperatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the machine,&rdquo; Dr. Kennedy said, 
rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to run.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry
I&rsquo;ve shaken you up, and at the same time I&rsquo;m 
glad.&nbsp; And know one thing, Isaac Ford&rsquo;s dab of unruly 
blood was remarkably small, and Joe Garland got it all.&nbsp; And
one other thing.&nbsp; If your father&rsquo;s left hand offend 
you, don&rsquo;t smite it off.&nbsp; Besides, Joe is all 
right.&nbsp; Frankly, if I could choose between you and him to 
live with me on a desert isle, I&rsquo;d choose Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little bare-legged children ran about him, playing, on the 
grass; but Percival Ford did not see them.&nbsp; He was gazing 
steadily at the singer under the <i>hau</i> tree.&nbsp; He even 
changed his position once, to get closer.&nbsp; The clerk of the 
Seaside went by, limping with age and dragging his reluctant 
feet.&nbsp; He had lived forty years on the Islands.&nbsp; 
Percival Ford beckoned to him, and the clerk came respectfully, 
and wondering that he should be noticed by Percival Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; Ford said, &ldquo;I want you to give me 
some information.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk sat down awkwardly, stunned by the unexpected 
honour.&nbsp; He blinked at the other and mumbled, &ldquo;Yes, 
sir, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, who is Joe Garland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk stared at him, blinked, cleared his throat, and said
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Percival Ford commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking me, sir,&rdquo; the other managed 
to articulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke to you seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk recoiled from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you don&rsquo;t 
know?&rdquo; he questioned, his question in itself the 
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; John broke off and looked
about him helplessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better ask 
somebody else?&nbsp; Everybody thought you knew.&nbsp; We always 
thought . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always thought that that was why you had it in for 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Photographs and miniatures of Isaac Ford were trooping through
his son&rsquo;s brain, and ghosts of Isaac Ford seemed in the air
about hint &ldquo;I wish you good night, sir,&rdquo; he could 
hear the clerk saying, and he saw him beginning to limp away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; he called abruptly.</p>
<p>John came back and stood near him, blinking and nervously 
moistening his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me yet, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about Joe Garland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about Joe Garland.&nbsp; Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your brother, sir, if I say it who 
shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, John.&nbsp; Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; the old man queried, 
content to linger, now that the crucial point was past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, John.&nbsp; Good night,&rdquo; was the 
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, thank you, sir.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s 
going to rain.&nbsp; Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the clear sky, filled only with stars and moonlight, 
fell a rain so fine and attenuated as to resemble a vapour 
spray.&nbsp; Nobody minded it; the children played on, running 
bare-legged over the grass and leaping into the sand; and in a 
few minutes it was gone.&nbsp; In the south-east, Diamond Head, a
black blot, sharply defined, silhouetted its crater-form against 
the stars.&nbsp; At sleepy intervals the surf flung its foam 
across the sands to the grass, and far out could be seen the 
black specks of swimmers under the moon.&nbsp; The voices of the 
singers, singing a waltz, died away; and in the silence, from 
somewhere under the trees, arose the laugh of a woman that was a 
love-cry.&nbsp; It startled Percival Ford, and it reminded him of
Dr. Kennedy&rsquo;s phrase.&nbsp; Down by the outrigger canoes, 
where they lay hauled out on the sand, he saw men and women, 
Kanakas, reclining languorously, like lotus-eaters, the women in 
white <i>holokus</i>; and against one such <i>holoku</i> he saw 
the dark head of the steersman of the canoe resting upon the 
woman&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; Farther down, where the strip of 
sand widened at the entrance to the lagoon, he saw a man and 
woman walking side by side.&nbsp; As they drew near the light 
<i>lanai</i>, he saw the woman&rsquo;s hand go down to her waist 
and disengage a girdling arm.&nbsp; And as they passed him, 
Percival Ford nodded to a captain he knew, and to a major&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; Smoke of life, that was it, an ample 
phrase.&nbsp; And again, from under the dark algaroba tree arose 
the laugh of a woman that was a love-cry; and past his chair, on 
the way to bed, a bare-legged youngster was led by a chiding 
Japanese nurse-maid.&nbsp; The voices of the singers broke softly
and meltingly into an Hawaiian love-song, and officers and women,
with encircling arms, were gliding and whirling on the 
<i>lanai</i>; and once again the woman laughed under the algaroba
trees.</p>
<p>And Percival Ford knew only disapproval of it all.&nbsp; He 
was irritated by the love-laugh of the woman, by the steersman 
with pillowed head on the white <i>holoku</i>, by the couples 
that walked on the beach, by the officers and women that danced, 
and by the voices of the singers singing of love, and his brother
singing there with them under the <i>hau</i> tree.&nbsp; The 
woman that laughed especially irritated him.&nbsp; A curious 
train of thought was aroused.&nbsp; He was Isaac Ford&rsquo;s 
son, and what had happened with Isaac Ford might happen with 
him.&nbsp; He felt in his cheeks the faint heat of a blush at the
thought, and experienced a poignant sense of shame.&nbsp; He was 
appalled by what was in his blood.&nbsp; It was like learning 
suddenly that his father had been a leper and that his own blood 
might bear the taint of that dread disease.&nbsp; Isaac Ford, the
austere soldier of the Lord&mdash;the old hypocrite!&nbsp; What 
difference between him and any beach-comber?&nbsp; The house of 
pride that Percival Ford had builded was tumbling about his 
ears.</p>
<p>The hours passed, the army people laughed and danced, the 
native orchestra played on, and Percival Ford wrestled with the 
abrupt and overwhelming problem that had been thrust upon 
him.&nbsp; He prayed quietly, his elbow on the table, his head 
bowed upon his hand, with all the appearance of any tired 
onlooker.&nbsp; Between the dances the army men and women and the
civilians fluttered up to him and buzzed conventionally, and when
they went back to the <i>lanai</i> he took up his wrestling where
he had left it off.</p>
<p>He began to patch together his shattered ideal of Isaac Ford, 
and for cement he used a cunning and subtle logic.&nbsp; It was 
of the sort that is compounded in the brain laboratories of 
egotists, and it worked.&nbsp; It was incontrovertible that his 
father had been made of finer clay than those about him; but 
still, old Isaac had been only in the process of becoming, while 
he, Percival Ford, had become.&nbsp; As proof of it, he 
rehabilitated his father and at the same time exalted 
himself.&nbsp; His lean little ego waxed to colossal 
proportions.&nbsp; He was great enough to forgive.&nbsp; He 
glowed at the thought of it.&nbsp; Isaac Ford had been great, but
he was greater, for he could forgive Isaac Ford and even restore 
him to the holy place in his memory, though the place was not 
quite so holy as it had been.&nbsp; Also, he applauded Isaac Ford
for having ignored the outcome of his one step aside.&nbsp; Very 
well, he, too, would ignore it.</p>
<p>The dance was breaking up.&nbsp; The orchestra had finished 
&ldquo;Aloha Oe&rdquo; and was preparing to go home.&nbsp; 
Percival Ford clapped his hands for the Japanese servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell that man I want to see him,&rdquo; he said, 
pointing out Joe Garland.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him to come here, 
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Garland approached and halted respectfully several paces 
away, nervously fingering the guitar which he still 
carried.&nbsp; The other did not ask him to sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my brother,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everybody knows that,&rdquo; was the reply, in 
tones of wonderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so I understand,&rdquo; Percival Ford said 
dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I did not know it till this 
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-brother waited uncomfortably in the silence that 
followed, during which Percival Ford coolly considered his next 
utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that first time I came to school and the 
boys ducked me?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you take my
part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-brother smiled bashfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Percival Ford said in 
the same dry fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other said.</p>
<p>Another silence fell.&nbsp; Servants were beginning to put out
the lights on the <i>lanai</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know . . . now,&rdquo; the half-brother said 
simply.</p>
<p>Percival Ford frowned.&nbsp; Then he looked the other over 
with a considering eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will you take to leave the Islands and never 
come back?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And never come back?&rdquo; Joe Garland faltered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is the only land I know.&nbsp; Other lands are 
cold.&nbsp; I do not know other lands.&nbsp; I have many friends 
here.&nbsp; In other lands there would not be one voice to say, 
&lsquo;<i>Aloha</i>, Joe, my boy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said never to come back,&rdquo; Percival Ford 
reiterated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>Alameda</i> sails tomorrow for 
San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Garland was bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know now 
that we are brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why,&rdquo; was the retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you
said yourself, everybody knows.&nbsp; I will make it worth your 
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All awkwardness and embarrassment disappeared from Joe 
Garland.&nbsp; Birth and station were bridged and reversed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to go?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to go and never come back,&rdquo; Percival 
Ford answered.</p>
<p>And in that moment, flashing and fleeting, it was given him to
see his brother tower above him like a mountain, and to feel 
himself dwindle and dwarf to microscopic insignificance.&nbsp; 
But it is not well for one to see himself truly, nor can one so 
see himself for long and live; and only for that flashing moment 
did Percival Ford see himself and his brother in true 
perspective.&nbsp; The next moment he was mastered by his meagre 
and insatiable ego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said, I will make it worth your while.&nbsp; You 
will not suffer.&nbsp; I will pay you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Joe Garland said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to turn away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; the other called.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see my 
lawyer tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Five hundred down and two hundred 
a month as long as you stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; Joe Garland answered 
softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are too kind.&nbsp; And anyway, I guess 
I don&rsquo;t want your money.&nbsp; I go tomorrow on the 
<i>Alameda</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked away, but did not say good-bye.</p>
<p>Percival Ford clapped his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he said to the Japanese, &ldquo;a 
lemonade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And over the lemonade he smiled long and contentedly to 
himself.</p>
<h2>KOOLAU THE LEPER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Because we are sick they take away our liberty.&nbsp; 
We have obeyed the law.&nbsp; We have done no wrong.&nbsp; And 
yet they would put us in prison.&nbsp; Molokai is a prison.&nbsp;
That you know.&nbsp; Niuli, there, his sister was sent to Molokai
seven years ago.&nbsp; He has not seen her since.&nbsp; Nor will 
he ever see her.&nbsp; She must stay there until she dies.&nbsp; 
This is not her will.&nbsp; It is not Niuli&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; 
It is the will of the white men who rule the land.&nbsp; And who 
are these white men?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know.&nbsp; We have it from our fathers and our 
fathers&rsquo; fathers.&nbsp; They came like lambs, speaking 
softly.&nbsp; Well might they speak softly, for we were many and 
strong, and all the islands were ours.&nbsp; As I say, they spoke
softly.&nbsp; They were of two kinds.&nbsp; The one kind asked 
our permission, our gracious permission, to preach to us the word
of God.&nbsp; The other kind asked our permission, our gracious 
permission, to trade with us.&nbsp; That was the beginning.&nbsp;
Today all the islands are theirs, all the land, all the 
cattle&mdash;everything is theirs.&nbsp; They that preached the 
word of God and they that preached the word of Rum have 
fore-gathered and become great chiefs.&nbsp; They live like kings
in houses of many rooms, with multitudes of servants to care for 
them.&nbsp; They who had nothing have everything, and if you, or 
I, or any Kanaka be hungry, they sneer and say, &lsquo;Well, why 
don&rsquo;t you work?&nbsp; There are the 
plantations.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Koolau paused.&nbsp; He raised one hand, and with gnarled and 
twisted fingers lifted up the blazing wreath of hibiscus that 
crowned his black hair.&nbsp; The moonlight bathed the scene in 
silver.&nbsp; It was a night of peace, though those who sat about
him and listened had all the seeming of battle-wrecks.&nbsp; 
Their faces were leonine.&nbsp; Here a space yawned in a face 
where should have been a nose, and there an arm-stump showed 
where a hand had rotted off.&nbsp; They were men and women beyond
the pale, the thirty of them, for upon them had been placed the 
mark of the beast.</p>
<p>They sat, flower-garlanded, in the perfumed, luminous night, 
and their lips made uncouth noises and their throats rasped 
approval of Koolau&rsquo;s speech.&nbsp; They were creatures who 
once had been men and women.&nbsp; But they were men and women no
longer.&nbsp; They were monsters&mdash;in face and form grotesque
caricatures of everything human.&nbsp; They were hideously maimed
and distorted, and had the seeming of creatures that had been 
racked in millenniums of hell.&nbsp; Their hands, when they 
possessed them, were like harpy claws.&nbsp; Their faces were the
misfits and slips, crushed and bruised by some mad god at play in
the machinery of life.&nbsp; Here and there were features which 
the mad god had smeared half away, and one woman wept scalding 
tears from twin pits of horror, where her eyes once had 
been.&nbsp; Some were in pain and groaned from their 
chests.&nbsp; Others coughed, making sounds like the tearing of 
tissue.&nbsp; Two were idiots, more like huge apes marred in the 
making, until even an ape were an angel.&nbsp; They mowed and 
gibbered in the moonlight, under crowns of drooping, golden 
blossoms.&nbsp; One, whose bloated ear-lobe flapped like a fan 
upon his shoulder, caught up a gorgeous flower of orange and 
scarlet and with it decorated the monstrous ear that flip-flapped
with his every movement.</p>
<p>And over these things Koolau was king.&nbsp; And this was his 
kingdom,&mdash;a flower-throttled gorge, with beetling cliffs and
crags, from which floated the blattings of wild goats.&nbsp; On 
three sides the grim walls rose, festooned in fantastic draperies
of tropic vegetation and pierced by cave-entrances&mdash;the 
rocky lairs of Koolau&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; On the fourth side 
the earth fell away into a tremendous abyss, and, far below, 
could be seen the summits of lesser peaks and crags, at whose 
bases foamed and rumbled the Pacific surge.&nbsp; In fine weather
a boat could land on the rocky beach that marked the entrance of 
Kalalau Valley, but the weather must be very fine.&nbsp; And a 
cool-headed mountaineer might climb from the beach to the head of
Kalalau Valley, to this pocket among the peaks where Koolau 
ruled; but such a mountaineer must be very cool of head, and he 
must know the wild-goat trails as well.&nbsp; The marvel was that
the mass of human wreckage that constituted Koolau&rsquo;s people
should have been able to drag its helpless misery over the giddy 
goat-trails to this inaccessible spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; Koolau began.</p>
<p>But one of the mowing, apelike travesties emitted a wild 
shriek of madness, and Koolau waited while the shrill cachination
was tossed back and forth among the rocky walls and echoed 
distantly through the pulseless night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brothers, is it not strange?&nbsp; Ours was the land, 
and behold, the land is not ours.&nbsp; What did these preachers 
of the word of God and the word of Rum give us for the 
land?&nbsp; Have you received one dollar, as much as one dollar, 
any one of you, for the land?&nbsp; Yet it is theirs, and in 
return they tell us we can go to work on the land, their land, 
and that what we produce by our toil shall be theirs.&nbsp; Yet 
in the old days we did not have to work.&nbsp; Also, when we are 
sick, they take away our freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who brought the sickness, Koolau?&rdquo; demanded 
Kiloliana, a lean and wiry man with a face so like a laughing 
faun&rsquo;s that one might expect to see the cloven hoofs under 
him.&nbsp; They were cloven, it was true, but the cleavages were 
great ulcers and livid putrefactions.&nbsp; Yet this was 
Kiloliana, the most daring climber of them all, the man who knew 
every goat-trail and who had led Koolau and his wretched 
followers into the recesses of Kalalau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, well questioned,&rdquo; Koolau answered.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Because we would not work the miles of sugar-cane where 
once our horses pastured, they brought the Chinese slaves from 
overseas.&nbsp; And with them came the Chinese 
sickness&mdash;that which we suffer from and because of which 
they would imprison us on Molokai.&nbsp; We were born on 
Kauai.&nbsp; We have been to the other islands, some here and 
some there, to Oahu, to Maui, to Hawaii, to Honolulu.&nbsp; Yet 
always did we come back to Kauai.&nbsp; Why did we come 
back?&nbsp; There must be a reason.&nbsp; Because we love 
Kauai.&nbsp; We were born here.&nbsp; Here we have lived.&nbsp; 
And here shall we die&mdash;unless&mdash;unless&mdash;there be 
weak hearts amongst us.&nbsp; Such we do not want.&nbsp; They are
fit for Molokai.&nbsp; And if there be such, let them not 
remain.&nbsp; Tomorrow the soldiers land on the shore.&nbsp; Let 
the weak hearts go down to them.&nbsp; They will be sent swiftly 
to Molokai.&nbsp; As for us, we shall stay and fight.&nbsp; But 
know that we will not die.&nbsp; We have rifles.&nbsp; You know 
the narrow trails where men must creep, one by one.&nbsp; I, 
alone, Koolau, who was once a cowboy on Niihau, can hold the 
trail against a thousand men.&nbsp; Here is Kapalei, who was once
a judge over men and a man with honour, but who is now a hunted 
rat, like you and me.&nbsp; Hear him.&nbsp; He is 
wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kapalei arose.&nbsp; Once he had been a judge.&nbsp; He had 
gone to college at Punahou.&nbsp; He had sat at meat with lords 
and chiefs and the high representatives of alien powers who 
protected the interests of traders and missionaries.&nbsp; Such 
had been Kapalei.&nbsp; But now, as Koolau had said, he was a 
hunted rat, a creature outside the law, sunk so deep in the mire 
of human horror that he was above the law as well as beneath 
it.&nbsp; His face was featureless, save for gaping orifices and 
for the lidless eyes that burned under hairless brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us not make trouble,&rdquo; he began.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;We ask to be left alone.&nbsp; But if they do not leave us
alone, then is the trouble theirs and the penalty.&nbsp; My 
fingers are gone, as you see.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held up his stumps 
of hands that all might see.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet have I the joint of
one thumb left, and it can pull a trigger as firmly as did its 
lost neighbour in the old days.&nbsp; We love Kauai.&nbsp; Let us
live here, or die here, but do not let us go to the prison of 
Molokai.&nbsp; The sickness is not ours.&nbsp; We have not 
sinned.&nbsp; The men who preached the word of God and the word 
of Rum brought the sickness with the coolie slaves who work the 
stolen land.&nbsp; I have been a judge.&nbsp; I know the law and 
the justice, and I say to you it is unjust to steal a man&rsquo;s
land, to make that man sick with the Chinese sickness, and then 
to put that man in prison for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is short, and the days are filled with 
pain,&rdquo; said Koolau.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us drink and dance and
be happy as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From one of the rocky lairs calabashes were produced and 
passed round.&nbsp; The calabashes were filled with the fierce 
distillation of the root of the <i>ti</i>-plant; and as the 
liquid fire coursed through them and mounted to their brains, 
they forgot that they had once been men and women, for they were 
men and women once more.&nbsp; The woman who wept scalding tears 
from open eye-pits was indeed a woman apulse with life as she 
plucked the strings of an <i>ukulele</i> and lifted her voice in 
a barbaric love-call such as might have come from the dark 
forest-depths of the primeval world.&nbsp; The air tingled with 
her cry, softly imperious and seductive.&nbsp; Upon a mat, timing
his rhythm to the woman&rsquo;s song Kiloliana danced.&nbsp; It 
was unmistakable.&nbsp; Love danced in all his movements, and, 
next, dancing with him on the mat, was a woman whose heavy hips 
and generous breast gave the lie to her disease-corroded 
face.&nbsp; It was a dance of the living dead, for in their 
disintegrating bodies life still loved and longed.&nbsp; Ever the
woman whose sightless eyes ran scalding tears chanted her 
love-cry, ever the dancers of love danced in the warm night, and 
ever the calabashes went around till in all their brains were 
maggots crawling of memory and desire.&nbsp; And with the woman 
on the mat danced a slender maid whose face was beautiful and 
unmarred, but whose twisted arms that rose and fell marked the 
disease&rsquo;s ravage.&nbsp; And the two idiots, gibbering and 
mouthing strange noises, danced apart, grotesque, fantastic, 
travestying love as they themselves had been travestied by 
life.</p>
<p>But the woman&rsquo;s love-cry broke midway, the calabashes 
were lowered, and the dancers ceased, as all gazed into the abyss
above the sea, where a rocket flared like a wan phantom through 
the moonlit air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the soldiers,&rdquo; said Koolau.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Tomorrow there will be fighting.&nbsp; It is well to sleep
and be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lepers obeyed, crawling away to their lairs in the cliff, 
until only Koolau remained, sitting motionless in the moonlight, 
his rifle across his knees, as he gazed far down to the boats 
landing on the beach.</p>
<p>The far head of Kalalau Valley had been well chosen as a 
refuge.&nbsp; Except Kiloliana, who knew back-trails up the 
precipitous walls, no man could win to the gorge save by 
advancing across a knife-edged ridge.&nbsp; This passage was a 
hundred yards in length.&nbsp; At best, it was a scant twelve 
inches wide.&nbsp; On either side yawned the abyss.&nbsp; A slip,
and to right or left the man would fall to his death.&nbsp; But 
once across he would find himself in an earthly paradise.&nbsp; A
sea of vegetation laved the landscape, pouring its green billows 
from wall to wall, dripping from the cliff-lips in great 
vine-masses, and flinging a spray of ferns and air-plants in to 
the multitudinous crevices.&nbsp; During the many months of 
Koolau&rsquo;s rule, he and his followers had fought with this 
vegetable sea.&nbsp; The choking jungle, with its riot of 
blossoms, had been driven back from the bananas, oranges, and 
mangoes that grew wild.&nbsp; In little clearings grew the wild 
arrowroot; on stone terraces, filled with soil scrapings, were 
the <i>taro</i> patches and the melons; and in every open space 
where the sunshine penetrated were <i>papaia</i> trees burdened 
with their golden fruit.</p>
<p>Koolau had been driven to this refuge from the lower valley by
the beach.&nbsp; And if he were driven from it in turn, he knew 
of gorges among the jumbled peaks of the inner fastnesses where 
he could lead his subjects and live.&nbsp; And now he lay with 
his rifle beside him, peering down through a tangled screen of 
foliage at the soldiers on the beach.&nbsp; He noted that they 
had large guns with them, from which the sunshine flashed as from
mirrors.&nbsp; The knife-edged passage lay directly before 
him.&nbsp; Crawling upward along the trail that led to it he 
could see tiny specks of men.&nbsp; He knew they were not the 
soldiers, but the police.&nbsp; When they failed, then the 
soldiers would enter the game.</p>
<p>He affectionately rubbed a twisted hand along his rifle barrel
and made sure that the sights were clean.&nbsp; He had learned to
shoot as a wild-cattle hunter on Niihau, and on that island his 
skill as a marksman was unforgotten.&nbsp; As the toiling specks 
of men grew nearer and larger, he estimated the range, judged the
deflection of the wind that swept at right angles across the line
of fire, and calculated the chances of overshooting marks that 
were so far below his level.&nbsp; But he did not shoot.&nbsp; 
Not until they reached the beginning of the passage did he make 
his presence known.&nbsp; He did not disclose himself, but spoke 
from the thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want Koolau, the leper,&rdquo; answered the man who 
led the native police, himself a blue-eyed American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go back,&rdquo; Koolau said.</p>
<p>He knew the man, a deputy sheriff, for it was by him that he 
had been harried out of Niihau, across Kauai, to Kalalau Valley, 
and out of the valley to the gorge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the sheriff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Koolau, the leper,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come out.&nbsp; We want you.&nbsp; Dead or alive, 
there is a thousand dollars on your head.&nbsp; You cannot 
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Koolau laughed aloud in the thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out!&rdquo; the sheriff commanded, and was 
answered by silence.</p>
<p>He conferred with the police, and Koolau saw that they were 
preparing to rush him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Koolau,&rdquo; the sheriff called.&nbsp; &ldquo;Koolau,
I am coming across to get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look first and well about you at the sun and sea 
and sky, for it will be the last time you behold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Koolau,&rdquo; the sheriff said
soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re a dead shot.&nbsp; 
But you won&rsquo;t shoot me.&nbsp; I have never done you any 
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Koolau grunted in the thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you know, I&rsquo;ve never done you any wrong, 
have I?&rdquo; the sheriff persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do me wrong when you try to put me in 
prison,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you do me wrong 
when you try for the thousand dollars on my head.&nbsp; If you 
will live, stay where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to come across and get you.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp; But it is my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will die before you get across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff was no coward.&nbsp; Yet was he undecided.&nbsp; 
He gazed into the gulf on either side and ran his eyes along the 
knife-edge he must travel.&nbsp; Then he made up his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Koolau,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>But the thicket remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Koolau, don&rsquo;t shoot.&nbsp; I am 
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff turned, gave some orders to the police, then 
started on his perilous way.&nbsp; He advanced slowly.&nbsp; It 
was like walking a tight rope.&nbsp; He had nothing to lean upon 
but the air.&nbsp; The lava rock crumbled under his feet, and on 
either side the dislodged fragments pitched downward through the 
depths.&nbsp; The sun blazed upon him, and his face was wet with 
sweat.&nbsp; Still he advanced, until the halfway point was 
reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Koolau commanded from the thicket.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;One more step and I shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff halted, swaying for balance as he stood poised 
above the void.&nbsp; His face was pale, but his eyes were 
determined.&nbsp; He licked his dry lips before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Koolau, you won&rsquo;t shoot me.&nbsp; I know you 
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started once more.&nbsp; The bullet whirled him half 
about.&nbsp; On his face was an expression of querulous surprise 
as he reeled to the fall.&nbsp; He tried to save himself by 
throwing his body across the knife-edge; but at that moment he 
knew death.&nbsp; The next moment the knife-edge was 
vacant.&nbsp; Then came the rush, five policemen, in single file,
with superb steadiness, running along the knife-edge.&nbsp; At 
the same instant the rest of the posse opened fire on the 
thicket.&nbsp; It was madness.&nbsp; Five times Koolau pulled the
trigger, so rapidly that his shots constituted a rattle.&nbsp; 
Changing his position and crouching low under the bullets that 
were biting and singing through the bushes, he peered out.&nbsp; 
Four of the police had followed the sheriff.&nbsp; The fifth lay 
across the knife-edge still alive.&nbsp; On the farther side, no 
longer firing, were the surviving police.&nbsp; On the naked rock
there was no hope for them.&nbsp; Before they could clamber down 
Koolau could have picked off the last man.&nbsp; But he did not 
fire, and, after a conference, one of them took off a white 
undershirt and waved it as a flag.&nbsp; Followed by another, he 
advanced along the knife-edge to their wounded comrade.&nbsp; 
Koolau gave no sign, but watched them slowly withdraw and become 
specks as they descended into the lower valley.</p>
<p>Two hours later, from another thicket, Koolau watched a body 
of police trying to make the ascent from the opposite side of the
valley.&nbsp; He saw the wild goats flee before them as they 
climbed higher and higher, until he doubted his judgment and sent
for Kiloliana, who crawled in beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no way,&rdquo; said Kiloliana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goats?&rdquo; Koolau questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come over from the next valley, but they cannot 
pass to this.&nbsp; There is no way.&nbsp; Those men are not 
wiser than goats.&nbsp; They may fall to their deaths.&nbsp; Let 
us watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are brave men,&rdquo; said Koolau.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Let us watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Side by side they lay among the morning-glories, with the 
yellow blossoms of the <i>hau</i> dropping upon them from 
overhead, watching the motes of men toil upward, till the thing 
happened, and three of them, slipping, rolling, sliding, dashed 
over a cliff-lip and fell sheer half a thousand feet.</p>
<p>Kiloliana chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be bothered no more,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have war guns,&rdquo; Koolau made answer.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The soldiers have not yet spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the drowsy afternoon, most of the lepers lay in their rock 
dens asleep.&nbsp; Koolau, his rifle on his knees, fresh-cleaned 
and ready, dozed in the entrance to his own den.&nbsp; The maid 
with the twisted arms lay below in the thicket and kept watch on 
the knife-edge passage.&nbsp; Suddenly Koolau was startled wide 
awake by the sound of an explosion on the beach.&nbsp; The next 
instant the atmosphere was incredibly rent asunder.&nbsp; The 
terrible sound frightened him.&nbsp; It was as if all the gods 
had caught the envelope of the sky in their hands and were 
ripping it apart as a woman rips apart a sheet of cotton 
cloth.&nbsp; But it was such an immense ripping, growing swiftly 
nearer.&nbsp; Koolau glanced up apprehensively, as if expecting 
to see the thing.&nbsp; Then high up on the cliff overhead the 
shell burst in a fountain of black smoke.&nbsp; The rock was 
shattered, the fragments falling to the foot of the cliff.</p>
<p>Koolau passed his hand across his sweaty brow.&nbsp; He was 
terribly shaken.&nbsp; He had had no experience with shell-fire, 
and this was more dreadful than anything he had imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; said Kapahei, suddenly bethinking himself 
to keep count.</p>
<p>A second and a third shell flew screaming over the top of the 
wall, bursting beyond view.&nbsp; Kapahei methodically kept the 
count.&nbsp; The lepers crowded into the open space before the 
caves.&nbsp; At first they were frightened, but as the shells 
continued their flight overhead the leper folk became reassured 
and began to admire the spectacle.</p>
<p>The two idiots shrieked with delight, prancing wild antics as 
each air-tormenting shell went by.&nbsp; Koolau began to recover 
his confidence.&nbsp; No damage was being done.&nbsp; Evidently 
they could not aim such large missiles at such long range with 
the precision of a rifle.</p>
<p>But a change came over the situation.&nbsp; The shells began 
to fall short.&nbsp; One burst below in the thicket by the 
knife-edge.&nbsp; Koolau remembered the maid who lay there on 
watch, and ran down to see.&nbsp; The smoke was still rising from
the bushes when he crawled in.&nbsp; He was astounded.&nbsp; The 
branches were splintered and broken.&nbsp; Where the girl had 
lain was a hole in the ground.&nbsp; The girl herself was in 
shattered fragments.&nbsp; The shell had burst right on her.</p>
<p>First peering out to make sure no soldiers were attempting the
passage, Koolau started back on the run for the caves.&nbsp; All 
the time the shells were moaning, whining, screaming by, and the 
valley was rumbling and reverberating with the explosions.&nbsp; 
As he came in sight of the caves, he saw the two idiots cavorting
about, clutching each other&rsquo;s hands with their stumps of 
fingers.&nbsp; Even as he ran, Koolau saw a spout of black smoke 
rise from the ground, near to the idiots.&nbsp; They were flung 
apart bodily by the explosion.&nbsp; One lay motionless, but the 
other was dragging himself by his hands toward the cave.&nbsp; 
His legs trailed out helplessly behind him, while the blood was 
pouring from his body.&nbsp; He seemed bathed in blood, and as he
crawled he cried like a little dog.&nbsp; The rest of the lepers,
with the exception of Kapahei, had fled into the caves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen,&rdquo; said Kapahei.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Eighteen,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>This last shell had fairly entered into one of the 
caves.&nbsp; The explosion caused the caves to empty.&nbsp; But 
from the particular cave no one emerged.&nbsp; Koolau crept in 
through the pungent, acrid smoke.&nbsp; Four bodies, frightfully 
mangled, lay about.&nbsp; One of them was the sightless woman 
whose tears till now had never ceased.</p>
<p>Outside, Koolau found his people in a panic and already 
beginning to climb the goat-trail that led out of the gorge and 
on among the jumbled heights and chasms.&nbsp; The wounded idiot,
whining feebly and dragging himself along on the ground by his 
hands, was trying to follow.&nbsp; But at the first pitch of the 
wall his helplessness overcame him and he fell back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better to kill him,&rdquo; said Koolau to 
Kapahei, who still sat in the same place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-two,&rdquo; Kapahei answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, 
it would be a wise thing to kill him.&nbsp; 
Twenty-three&mdash;twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idiot whined sharply when he saw the rifle levelled at 
him.&nbsp; Koolau hesitated, then lowered the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a hard thing to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a fool, twenty-six, twenty-seven,&rdquo; said 
Kapahei.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose, and with a heavy fragment of rock in his hand, 
approached the wounded thing.&nbsp; As he lifted his arm to 
strike, a shell burst full upon him, relieving him of the 
necessity of the act and at the same time putting an end to his 
count.</p>
<p>Koolau was alone in the gorge.&nbsp; He watched the last of 
his people drag their crippled bodies over the brow of the height
and disappear.&nbsp; Then he turned and went down to the thicket 
where the maid had keen killed.&nbsp; The shell-fire still 
continued, but he remained; for far below he could see the 
soldiers climbing up.&nbsp; A shell burst twenty feet away.&nbsp;
Flattening himself into the earth, he heard the rush of the 
fragments above his body.&nbsp; A shower of hau blossoms rained 
upon him.&nbsp; He lifted his head to peer down the trail, and 
sighed.&nbsp; He was very much afraid.&nbsp; Bullets from rifles 
would not have worried him, but this shell-fire was 
abominable.&nbsp; Each time a shell shrieked by he shivered and 
crouched; but each time he lifted his head again to watch the 
trail.</p>
<p>At last the shells ceased.&nbsp; This, he reasoned, was 
because the soldiers were drawing near.&nbsp; They crept along 
the trail in single file, and he tried to count them until he 
lost track.&nbsp; At any rate, there were a hundred or so of 
them&mdash;all come after Koolau the leper.&nbsp; He felt a 
fleeting prod of pride.&nbsp; With war guns and rifles, police 
and soldiers, they came for him, and he was only one man, a 
crippled wreck of a man at that.&nbsp; They offered a thousand 
dollars for him, dead or alive.&nbsp; In all his life he had 
never possessed that much money.&nbsp; The thought was a bitter 
one.&nbsp; Kapahei had been right.&nbsp; He, Koolau, had done no 
wrong.&nbsp; Because the <i>haoles</i> wanted labour with which 
to work the stolen land, they had brought in the Chinese coolies,
and with them had come the sickness.&nbsp; And now, because he 
had caught the sickness, he was worth a thousand 
dollars&mdash;but not to himself.&nbsp; It was his worthless 
carcass, rotten with disease or dead from a bursting shell, that 
was worth all that money.</p>
<p>When the soldiers reached the knife-edged passage, he was 
prompted to warn them.&nbsp; But his gaze fell upon the body of 
the murdered maid, and he kept silent.&nbsp; When six had 
ventured on the knife-edge, he opened fire.&nbsp; Nor did he 
cease when the knife-edge was bare.&nbsp; He emptied his 
magazine, reloaded, and emptied it again.&nbsp; He kept on 
shooting.&nbsp; All his wrongs were blazing in his brain, and he 
was in a fury of vengeance.&nbsp; All down the goat-trail the 
soldiers were firing, and though they lay flat and sought to 
shelter themselves in the shallow inequalities of the surface, 
they were exposed marks to him.&nbsp; Bullets whistled and 
thudded about him, and an occasional ricochet sang sharply 
through the air.&nbsp; One bullet ploughed a crease through his 
scalp, and a second burned across his shoulder-blade without 
breaking the skin.</p>
<p>It was a massacre, in which one man did the killing.&nbsp; The
soldiers began to retreat, helping along their wounded.&nbsp; As 
Koolau picked them off he became aware of the smell of burnt 
meat.&nbsp; He glanced about him at first, and then discovered 
that it was his own hands.&nbsp; The heat of the rifle was doing 
it.&nbsp; The leprosy had destroyed most of the nerves in his 
hands.&nbsp; Though his flesh burned and he smelled it, there was
no sensation.</p>
<p>He lay in the thicket, smiling, until he remembered the war 
guns.&nbsp; Without doubt they would open upon him again, and 
this time upon the very thicket from which he had inflicted the 
danger.&nbsp; Scarcely had he changed his position to a nook 
behind a small shoulder of the wall where he had noted that no 
shells fell, than the bombardment recommenced.&nbsp; He counted 
the shells.&nbsp; Sixty more were thrown into the gorge before 
the war-guns ceased.&nbsp; The tiny area was pitted with their 
explosions, until it seemed impossible that any creature could 
have survived.&nbsp; So the soldiers thought, for, under the 
burning afternoon sun, they climbed the goat-trail again.&nbsp; 
And again the knife-edged passage was disputed, and again they 
fell back to the beach.</p>
<p>For two days longer Koolau held the passage, though the 
soldiers contented themselves with flinging shells into his 
retreat.&nbsp; Then Pahau, a leper boy, came to the top of the 
wall at the back of the gorge and shouted down to him that 
Kiloliana, hunting goats that they might eat, had been killed by 
a fall, and that the women were frightened and knew not what to 
do.&nbsp; Koolau called the boy down and left him with a spare 
gun with which to guard the passage.&nbsp; Koolau found his 
people disheartened.&nbsp; The majority of them were too helpless
to forage food for themselves under such forbidding 
circumstances, and all were starving.&nbsp; He selected two women
and a man who were not too far gone with the disease, and sent 
them back to the gorge to bring up food and mats.&nbsp; The rest 
he cheered and consoled until even the weakest took a hand in 
building rough shelters for themselves.</p>
<p>But those he had dispatched for food did not return, and he 
started back for the gorge.&nbsp; As he came out on the brow of 
the wall, half a dozen rifles cracked.&nbsp; A bullet tore 
through the fleshy part of his shoulder, and his cheek was cut by
a sliver of rock where a second bullet smashed against the 
cliff.&nbsp; In the moment that this happened, and he leaped 
back, he saw that the gorge was alive with soldiers.&nbsp; His 
own people had betrayed him.&nbsp; The shell-fire had been too 
terrible, and they had preferred the prison of Molokai.</p>
<p>Koolau dropped back and unslung one of his heavy 
cartridge-belts.&nbsp; Lying among the rocks, he allowed the head
and shoulders of the first soldier to rise clearly into view 
before pulling trigger.&nbsp; Twice this happened, and then, 
after some delay, in place of a head and shoulders a white flag 
was thrust above the edge of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you, if you are Koolau the leper,&rdquo; came 
the answer.</p>
<p>Koolau forgot where he was, forgot everything, as he lay and 
marvelled at the strange persistence of these <i>haoles</i> who 
would have their will though the sky fell in.&nbsp; Aye, they 
would have their will over all men and all things, even though 
they died in getting it.&nbsp; He could not but admire them, too,
what of that will in them that was stronger than life and that 
bent all things to their bidding.&nbsp; He was convinced of the 
hopelessness of his struggle.&nbsp; There was no gainsaying that 
terrible will of the <i>haoles</i>.&nbsp; Though he killed a 
thousand, yet would they rise like the sands of the sea and come 
upon him, ever more and more.&nbsp; They never knew when they 
were beaten.&nbsp; That was their fault and their virtue.&nbsp; 
It was where his own kind lacked.&nbsp; He could see, now, how 
the handful of the preachers of God and the preachers of Rum had 
conquered the land.&nbsp; It was because&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you got to say?&nbsp; Will you come 
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was he voice of the invisible man under the white 
flag.&nbsp; There he was, like any haole, driving straight toward
the end determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us talk,&rdquo; said Koolau.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s head and shoulders arose, then his whole 
body.&nbsp; He was a smooth-faced, blue-eyed youngster of 
twenty-five, slender and natty in his captain&rsquo;s 
uniform.&nbsp; He advanced until halted, then seated himself a 
dozen feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a brave man,&rdquo; said Koolau 
wonderingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could kill you like a fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are a man, Koolau, though a bad one.&nbsp; 
I know your story.&nbsp; You kill fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Koolau grunted, but was secretly pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with my people?&rdquo; he 
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boy, the two women, and the 
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They gave themselves up, as I have now come for you to 
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Koolau laughed incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a free man,&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
have done no wrong.&nbsp; All I ask is to be left alone.&nbsp; I 
have lived free, and I shall die free.&nbsp; I will never give 
myself up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your people are wiser than you,&rdquo; answered 
the young captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look&mdash;they are coming 
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Koolau turned and watched the remnant of his band 
approach.&nbsp; Groaning and sighing, a ghastly procession, it 
dragged its wretchedness past.&nbsp; It was given to Koolau to 
taste a deeper bitterness, for they hurled imprecations and 
insults at him as they went by; and the panting hag who brought 
up the rear halted, and with skinny, harpy-claws extended, 
shaking her snarling death&rsquo;s head from side to side, she 
laid a curse upon him.&nbsp; One by one they dropped over the 
lip-edge and surrendered to the hiding soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go now,&rdquo; said Koolau to the 
captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will never give myself up.&nbsp; That is 
my last word.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain slipped over the cliff to his soldiers.&nbsp; The 
next moment, and without a flag of truce, he hoisted his hat on 
his scabbard, and Koolau&rsquo;s bullet tore through it.&nbsp; 
That afternoon they shelled him out from the beach, and as he 
retreated into the high inaccessible pockets beyond, the soldiers
followed him.</p>
<p>For six weeks they hunted him from pocket to pocket, over the 
volcanic peaks and along the goat-trails.&nbsp; When he hid in 
the lantana jungle, they formed lines of beaters, and through 
lantana jungle and guava scrub they drove him like a 
rabbit.&nbsp; But ever he turned and doubled and eluded.&nbsp; 
There was no cornering him.&nbsp; When pressed too closely, his 
sure rifle held them back and they carried their wounded down the
goat-trails to the beach.&nbsp; There were times when they did 
the shooting as his brown body showed for a moment through the 
underbrush.&nbsp; Once, five of them caught him on an exposed 
goat-trail between pockets.&nbsp; They emptied their rifles at 
him as he limped and climbed along his dizzy way.&nbsp; 
Afterwards they found bloodstains and knew that he was 
wounded.&nbsp; At the end of six weeks they gave up.&nbsp; The 
soldiers and police returned to Honolulu, and Kalalau Valley was 
left to him for his own, though head-hunters ventured after him 
from time to time and to their own undoing.</p>
<p>Two years later, and for the last time, Koolau crawled into a 
thicket and lay down among the <i>ti</i>-leaves and wild ginger 
blossoms.&nbsp; Free he had lived, and free he was dying.&nbsp; A
slight drizzle of rain began to fall, and he drew a ragged 
blanket about the distorted wreck of his limbs.&nbsp; His body 
was covered with an oilskin coat.&nbsp; Across his chest he laid 
his Mauser rifle, lingering affectionately for a moment to wipe 
the dampness from the barrel.&nbsp; The hand with which he wiped 
had no fingers left upon it with which to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, for, from the weakness in his body and the
fuzzy turmoil in his brain, he knew that his end was near.&nbsp; 
Like a wild animal he had crept into hiding to die.&nbsp; 
Half-conscious, aimless and wandering, he lived back in his life 
to his early manhood on Niihau.&nbsp; As life faded and the drip 
of the rain grew dim in his ears it seemed to him that he was 
once more in the thick of the horse-breaking, with raw colts 
rearing and bucking under him, his stirrups tied together 
beneath, or charging madly about the breaking corral and driving 
the helping cowboys over the rails.&nbsp; The next instant, and 
with seeming naturalness, he found himself pursuing the wild 
bulls of the upland pastures, roping them and leading them down 
to the valleys.&nbsp; Again the sweat and dust of the branding 
pen stung his eyes and bit his nostrils.</p>
<p>All his lusty, whole-bodied youth was his, until the sharp 
pangs of impending dissolution brought him back.&nbsp; He lifted 
his monstrous hands and gazed at them in wonder.&nbsp; But 
how?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Why should the wholeness of that wild youth
of his change to this?&nbsp; Then he remembered, and once again, 
and for a moment, he was Koolau, the leper.&nbsp; His eyelids 
fluttered wearily down and the drip of the rain ceased in his 
ears.&nbsp; A prolonged trembling set up in his body.&nbsp; This,
too, ceased.&nbsp; He half-lifted his head, but it fell 
back.&nbsp; Then his eyes opened, and did not close.&nbsp; His 
last thought was of his Mauser, and he pressed it against his 
chest with his folded, fingerless hands.</p>
<h2>GOOD-BYE, JACK</h2>
<p>Hawaii is a queer place.&nbsp; Everything socially is what I 
may call topsy-turvy.&nbsp; Not but what things are 
correct.&nbsp; They are almost too much so.&nbsp; But still 
things are sort of upside down.&nbsp; The most ultra-exclusive 
set there is the &ldquo;Missionary Crowd.&rdquo;&nbsp; It comes 
with rather a shock to learn that in Hawaii the obscure 
martyrdom-seeking missionary sits at the head of the table of the
moneyed aristocracy.&nbsp; But it is true.&nbsp; The humble New 
Englanders who came out in the third decade of the nineteenth 
century, came for the lofty purpose of teaching the kanakas the 
true religion, the worship of the one only genuine and undeniable
God.&nbsp; So well did they succeed in this, and also in 
civilizing the kanaka, that by the second or third generation he 
was practically extinct.&nbsp; This being the fruit of the seed 
of the Gospel, the fruit of the seed of the missionaries (the 
sons and the grandsons) was the possession of the islands 
themselves,&mdash;of the land, the ports, the town sites, and the
sugar plantations:&nbsp; The missionary who came to give the 
bread of life remained to gobble up the whole heathen feast.</p>
<p>But that is not the Hawaiian queerness I started out to 
tell.&nbsp; Only one cannot speak of things Hawaiian without 
mentioning the missionaries.&nbsp; There is Jack Kersdale, the 
man I wanted to tell about; he came of missionary stock.&nbsp; 
That is, on his grandmother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; His grandfather 
was old Benjamin Kersdale, a Yankee trader, who got his start for
a million in the old days by selling cheap whiskey and 
square-face gin.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s another queer thing.&nbsp; 
The old missionaries and old traders were mortal enemies.&nbsp; 
You see, their interests conflicted.&nbsp; But their children 
made it up by intermarrying and dividing the island between 
them.</p>
<p>Life in Hawaii is a song.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way Stoddard 
put it in his &ldquo;Hawaii Noi&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thy life is music&mdash;Fate the notes 
prolong!<br />
Each isle a stanza, and the whole a song.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he was right.&nbsp; Flesh is golden there.&nbsp; The 
native women are sun-ripe Junos, the native men bronzed 
Apollos.&nbsp; They sing, and dance, and all are 
flower-bejewelled and flower-crowned.&nbsp; And, outside the 
rigid &ldquo;Missionary Crowd,&rdquo; the white men yield to the 
climate and the sun, and no matter how busy they may be, are 
prone to dance and sing and wear flowers behind their ears and in
their hair.&nbsp; Jack Kersdale was one of these fellows.&nbsp; 
He was one of the busiest men I ever met.&nbsp; He was a 
several-times millionaire.&nbsp; He was a sugar-king, a coffee 
planter, a rubber pioneer, a cattle rancher, and a promoter of 
three out of every four new enterprises launched in the 
islands.&nbsp; He was a society man, a club man, a yachtsman, a 
bachelor, and withal as handsome a man as was ever doted upon by 
mammas with marriageable daughters.&nbsp; Incidentally, he had 
finished his education at Yale, and his head was crammed fuller 
with vital statistics and scholarly information concerning Hawaii
Nei than any other islander I ever encountered.&nbsp; He turned 
off an immense amount of work, and he sang and danced and put 
flowers in his hair as immensely as any of the idlers.&nbsp; He 
had grit, and had fought two duels&mdash;both, 
political&mdash;when he was no more than a raw youth essaying his
first adventures in politics.&nbsp; In fact, he played a most 
creditable and courageous part in the last revolution, when the 
native dynasty was overthrown; and he could not have been over 
sixteen at the time.&nbsp; I am pointing out that he was no 
coward, in order that you may appreciate what happens later 
on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen him in the breaking yard at the 
Haleakala Ranch, conquering a four-year-old brute that for two 
years had defied the pick of Von Tempsky&rsquo;s cow-boys.&nbsp; 
And I must tell of one other thing.&nbsp; It was down in 
Kona,&mdash;or up, rather, for the Kona people scorn to live at 
less than a thousand feet elevation.&nbsp; We were all on the 
<i>lanai</i> of Doctor Goodhue&rsquo;s bungalow.&nbsp; I was 
talking with Dottie Fairchild when it happened.&nbsp; A big 
centipede&mdash;it was seven inches, for we measured it 
afterwards&mdash;fell from the rafters overhead squarely into her
coiffure.&nbsp; I confess, the hideousness of it paralysed 
me.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t move.&nbsp; My mind refused to 
work.&nbsp; There, within two feet of me, the ugly venomous devil
was writhing in her hair.&nbsp; It threatened at any moment to 
fall down upon her exposed shoulders&mdash;we had just come out 
from dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, starting to raise her 
hand to her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; she insisted, growing frightened
by the fright she read in my eyes and on my stammering lips.</p>
<p>My exclamation attracted Kersdale&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; He 
glanced our way carelessly, but in that glance took in 
everything.&nbsp; He came over to us, but without haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move, Dottie,&rdquo; he said 
quietly.</p>
<p>He never hesitated, nor did he hurry and make a bungle of 
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And with one hand he caught her scarf and drew it tightly 
around her shoulders so that the centipede could not fall inside 
her bodice.&nbsp; With the other hand&mdash;the right&mdash;he 
reached into her hair, caught the repulsive abomination as near 
as he was able by the nape of the neck, and held it tightly 
between thumb and forefinger as he withdrew it from her 
hair.&nbsp; It was as horrible and heroic a sight as man could 
wish to see.&nbsp; It made my flesh crawl.&nbsp; The centipede, 
seven inches of squirming legs, writhed and twisted and dashed 
itself about his hand, the body twining around the fingers and 
the legs digging into the skin and scratching as the beast 
endeavoured to free itself.&nbsp; It bit him twice&mdash;I saw 
it&mdash;though he assured the ladies that he was not harmed as 
he dropped it upon the walk and stamped it into the gravel.&nbsp;
But I saw him in the surgery five minutes afterwards, with Doctor
Goodhue scarifying the wounds and injecting permanganate of 
potash.&nbsp; The next morning Kersdale&rsquo;s arm was as big as
a barrel, and it was three weeks before the swelling went 
down.</p>
<p>All of which has nothing to do with my story, but which I 
could not avoid giving in order to show that Jack Kersdale was 
anything but a coward.&nbsp; It was the cleanest exhibition of 
grit I have ever seen.&nbsp; He never turned a hair.&nbsp; The 
smile never left his lips.&nbsp; And he dived with thumb and 
forefinger into Dottie Fairchild&rsquo;s hair as gaily as if it 
had been a box of salted almonds.&nbsp; Yet that was the man I 
was destined to see stricken with a fear a thousand times more 
hideous even than the fear that was mine when I saw that writhing
abomination in Dottie Fairchild&rsquo;s hair, dangling over her 
eyes and the trap of her bodice.</p>
<p>I was interested in leprosy, and upon that, as upon every 
other island subject, Kersdale had encyclopedic knowledge.&nbsp; 
In fact, leprosy was one of his hobbies.&nbsp; He was an ardent 
defender of the settlement at Molokai, where all the island 
lepers were segregated.&nbsp; There was much talk and feeling 
among the natives, fanned by the demagogues, concerning the 
cruelties of Molokai, where men and women, not alone banished 
from friends and family, were compelled to live in perpetual 
imprisonment until they died.&nbsp; There were no reprieves, no 
commutations of sentences.&nbsp; &ldquo;Abandon hope&rdquo; was 
written over the portal of Molokai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you they are happy there,&rdquo; Kersdale 
insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they are infinitely better off than 
their friends and relatives outside who have nothing the matter 
with them.&nbsp; The horrors of Molokai are all poppycock.&nbsp; 
I can take you through any hospital or any slum in any of the 
great cities of the world and show you a thousand times worse 
horrors.&nbsp; The living death!&nbsp; The creatures that once 
were men!&nbsp; Bosh!&nbsp; You ought to see those living deaths 
racing horses on the Fourth of July.&nbsp; Some of them own 
boats.&nbsp; One has a gasoline launch.&nbsp; They have nothing 
to do but have a good time.&nbsp; Food, shelter, clothes, medical
attendance, everything, is theirs.&nbsp; They are the wards of 
the Territory.&nbsp; They have a much finer climate than 
Honolulu, and the scenery is magnificent.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
mind going down there myself for the rest of my days.&nbsp; It is
a lovely spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Kersdale on the joyous leper.&nbsp; He was not afraid of 
leprosy.&nbsp; He said so himself, and that there wasn&rsquo;t 
one chance in a million for him or any other white man to catch 
it, though he confessed afterward that one of his school chums, 
Alfred Starter, had contracted it, gone to Molokai, and there 
died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, in the old days,&rdquo; Kersdale explained, 
&ldquo;there was no certain test for leprosy.&nbsp; Anything 
unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to 
Molokai.&nbsp; The result was that dozens were sent there who 
were no more lepers than you or I.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t 
make that mistake now.&nbsp; The Board of Health tests are 
infallible.&nbsp; The funny thing is that when the test was 
discovered they immediately went down to Molokai and applied it, 
and they found a number who were not lepers.&nbsp; These were 
immediately deported.&nbsp; Happy to get away?&nbsp; They wailed 
harder at leaving the settlement than when they left Honolulu to 
go to it.&nbsp; Some refused to leave, and really had to be 
forced out.&nbsp; One of them even married a leper woman in the 
last stages and then wrote pathetic letters to the Board of 
Health, protesting against his expulsion on the ground that no 
one was so well able as he to take care of his poor old 
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this infallible test?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bacteriological test.&nbsp; There is no getting 
away from it.&nbsp; Doctor Hervey&mdash;he&rsquo;s our expert, 
you know&mdash;was the first man to apply it here.&nbsp; He is a 
wizard.&nbsp; He knows more about leprosy than any living man, 
and if a cure is ever discovered, he&rsquo;ll be that 
discoverer.&nbsp; As for the test, it is very simple.&nbsp; They 
have succeeded in isolating the <i>bacillus leprae</i> and 
studying it.&nbsp; They know it now when they see it.&nbsp; All 
they do is to snip a bit of skin from the suspect and subject it 
to the bacteriological test.&nbsp; A man without any visible 
symptoms may be chock full of the leprosy bacilli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you or I, for all we know,&rdquo; I suggested, 
&ldquo;may be full of it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kersdale shrugged his shoulders and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can say?&nbsp; It takes seven years for it to 
incubate.&nbsp; If you have any doubts go and see Doctor 
Hervey.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll just snip out a piece of your skin and 
let you know in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on he introduced me to Dr. Hervey, who loaded me down 
with Board of Health reports and pamphlets on the subject, and 
took me out to Kalihi, the Honolulu receiving station, where 
suspects were examined and confirmed lepers were held for 
deportation to Molokai.&nbsp; These deportations occurred about 
once a month, when, the last good-byes said, the lepers were 
marched on board the little steamer, the <i>Noeau</i>, and 
carried down to the settlement.</p>
<p>One afternoon, writing letters at the club, Jack Kersdale 
dropped in on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the man I want to see,&rdquo; was his 
greeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the saddest aspect of 
the whole situation&mdash;the lepers wailing as they depart for 
Molokai.&nbsp; The <i>Noeau</i> will be taking them on board in a
few minutes.&nbsp; But let me warn you not to let your feelings 
be harrowed.&nbsp; Real as their grief is, they&rsquo;d wail a 
whole sight harder a year hence if the Board of Health tried to 
take them away from Molokai.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve just time for a 
whiskey and soda.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a carriage outside.&nbsp; It 
won&rsquo;t take us five minutes to get down to the 
wharf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the wharf we drove.&nbsp; Some forty sad wretches, amid 
their mats, blankets, and luggage of various sorts, were 
squatting on the stringer piece.&nbsp; The Noeau had just arrived
and was making fast to a lighter that lay between her and the 
wharf.&nbsp; A Mr. McVeigh, the superintendent of the settlement,
was overseeing the embarkation, and to him I was introduced, also
to Dr. Georges, one of the Board of Health physicians whom I had 
already met at Kalihi.&nbsp; The lepers were a woebegone 
lot.&nbsp; The faces of the majority were hideous&mdash;too 
horrible for me to describe.&nbsp; But here and there I noticed 
fairly good-looking persons, with no apparent signs of the fell 
disease upon them.&nbsp; One, I noticed, a little white girl, not
more than twelve, with blue eyes and golden hair.&nbsp; One 
cheek, however, showed the leprous bloat.&nbsp; On my remarking 
on the sadness of her alien situation among the brown-skinned 
afflicted ones, Doctor Georges replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a happy day in
her life.&nbsp; She comes from Kauai.&nbsp; Her father is a 
brute.&nbsp; And now that she has developed the disease she is 
going to join her mother at the settlement.&nbsp; Her mother was 
sent down three years ago&mdash;a very bad case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t always tell from appearances,&rdquo; 
Mr. McVeigh explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;That man there, that big 
chap, who looks the pink of condition, with nothing the matter 
with him, I happen to know has a perforating ulcer in his foot 
and another in his shoulder-blade.&nbsp; Then there are 
others&mdash;there, see that girl&rsquo;s hand, the one who is 
smoking the cigarette.&nbsp; See her twisted fingers.&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s the an&aelig;sthetic form.&nbsp; It attacks the 
nerves.&nbsp; You could cut her fingers off with a dull knife, or
rub them off on a nutmeg-grater, and she would not experience the
slightest sensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that fine-looking woman, there,&rdquo; I 
persisted; &ldquo;surely, surely, there can&rsquo;t be anything 
the matter with her.&nbsp; She is too glorious and gorgeous 
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sad case,&rdquo; Mr. McVeigh answered over his 
shoulder, already turning away to walk down the wharf with 
Kersdale.</p>
<p>She was a beautiful woman, and she was pure Polynesian.&nbsp; 
From my meagre knowledge of the race and its types I could not 
but conclude that she had descended from old chief stock.&nbsp; 
She could not have been more than twenty-three or four.&nbsp; Her
lines and proportions were magnificent, and she was just 
beginning to show the amplitude of the women of her race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a blow to all of us,&rdquo; Dr. Georges 
volunteered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She gave herself up voluntarily, 
too.&nbsp; No one suspected.&nbsp; But somehow she had contracted
the disease.&nbsp; It broke us all up, I assure you.&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;ve kept it out of the papers, though.&nbsp; Nobody but 
us and her family knows what has become of her.&nbsp; In fact, if
you were to ask any man in Honolulu, he&rsquo;d tell you it was 
his impression that she was somewhere in Europe.&nbsp; It was at 
her request that we&rsquo;ve been so quiet about it.&nbsp; Poor 
girl, she has a lot of pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is she?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly,
from the way you talk about her, she must be somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of Lucy Mokunui?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy Mokunui?&rdquo; I repeated, haunted by some 
familiar association.&nbsp; I shook my head.&nbsp; &ldquo;It 
seems to me I&rsquo;ve heard the name, but I&rsquo;ve forgotten 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of Lucy Mokunui!&nbsp; The Hawaiian 
nightingale!&nbsp; I beg your pardon.&nbsp; Of course you are a 
<i>malahini</i>, <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1" 
class="citation">[1]</a> and could not be expected to know.&nbsp;
Well, Lucy Mokunui was the best beloved of Honolulu&mdash;of all 
Hawaii, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say was,&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I mean it.&nbsp; She is finished.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
shrugged his shoulders pityingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A dozen 
<i>haoles</i>&mdash;I beg your pardon, white men&mdash;have lost 
their hearts to her at one time or another.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m 
not counting in the ruck.&nbsp; The dozen I refer to were 
<i>haoles</i> of position and prominence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could have married the son of the Chief Justice if 
she&rsquo;d wanted to.&nbsp; You think she&rsquo;s beautiful, 
eh?&nbsp; But you should hear her sing.&nbsp; Finest native woman
singer in Hawaii Nei.&nbsp; Her throat is pure silver and melted 
sunshine.&nbsp; We adored her.&nbsp; She toured America first 
with the Royal Hawaiian Band.&nbsp; After that she made two more 
trips on her own&mdash;concert work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember now.&nbsp; 
I heard her two years ago at the Boston Symphony.&nbsp; So that 
is she.&nbsp; I recognize her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was oppressed by a heavy sadness.&nbsp; Life was a futile 
thing at best.&nbsp; A short two years and this magnificent 
creature, at the summit of her magnificent success, was one of 
the leper squad awaiting deportation to Molokai.&nbsp; 
Henley&rsquo;s lines came into my mind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The poor old tramp explains his poor old 
ulcers;<br />
Life is, I think, a blunder and a shame.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recoiled from my own future.&nbsp; If this awful fate fell 
to Lucy Mokunui, what might my lot not be?&mdash;or 
anybody&rsquo;s lot?&nbsp; I was thoroughly aware that in life we
are in the midst of death&mdash;but to be in the midst of living 
death, to die and not be dead, to be one of that draft of 
creatures that once were men, aye, and women, like Lucy Mokunui, 
the epitome of all Polynesian charms, an artist as well, and well
beloved of men&mdash;.&nbsp; I am afraid I must have betrayed my 
perturbation, for Doctor Georges hastened to assure me that they 
were very happy down in the settlement.</p>
<p>It was all too inconceivably monstrous.&nbsp; I could not bear
to look at her.&nbsp; A short distance away, behind a stretched 
rope guarded by a policeman, were the lepers&rsquo; relatives and
friends.&nbsp; They were not allowed to come near.&nbsp; There 
were no last embraces, no kisses of farewell.&nbsp; They called 
back and forth to one another&mdash;last messages, last words of 
love, last reiterated instructions.&nbsp; And those behind the 
rope looked with terrible intensity.&nbsp; It was the last time 
they would behold the faces of their loved ones, for they were 
the living dead, being carted away in the funeral ship to the 
graveyard of Molokai.</p>
<p>Doctor Georges gave the command, and the unhappy wretches 
dragged themselves to their feet and under their burdens of 
luggage began to stagger across the lighter and aboard the 
steamer.&nbsp; It was the funeral procession.&nbsp; At once the 
wailing started from those behind the rope.&nbsp; It was 
blood-curdling; it was heart-rending.&nbsp; I never heard such 
woe, and I hope never to again.&nbsp; Kersdale and McVeigh were 
still at the other end of the wharf, talking 
earnestly&mdash;politics, of course, for both were 
head-over-heels in that particular game.&nbsp; When Lucy Mokunui 
passed me, I stole a look at her.&nbsp; She <i>was</i> 
beautiful.&nbsp; She was beautiful by our standards, as 
well&mdash;one of those rare blossoms that occur but once in 
generations.&nbsp; And she, of all women, was doomed to 
Molokai.&nbsp; She straight on board, and aft on the open deck 
where the lepers huddled by the rail, wailing now, to their dear 
ones on shore.</p>
<p>The lines were cast off, and the <i>Noeau</i> began to move 
away from the wharf.&nbsp; The wailing increased.&nbsp; Such 
grief and despair!&nbsp; I was just resolving that never again 
would I be a witness to the sailing of the <i>Noeau</i>, when 
McVeigh and Kersdale returned.&nbsp; The latter&rsquo;s eyes were
sparkling, and his lips could not quite hide the smile of delight
that was his.&nbsp; Evidently the politics they had talked had 
been satisfactory.&nbsp; The rope had been flung aside, and the 
lamenting relatives now crowded the stringer piece on either side
of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her mother,&rdquo; Doctor Georges 
whispered, indicating an old woman next to me, who was rocking 
back and forth and gazing at the steamer rail out of tear-blinded
eyes.&nbsp; I noticed that Lucy Mokunui was also wailing.&nbsp; 
She stopped abruptly and gazed at Kersdale.&nbsp; Then she 
stretched forth her arms in that adorable, sensuous way that Olga
Nethersole has of embracing an audience.&nbsp; And with arms 
outspread, she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Jack!&nbsp; Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the cry, and looked.&nbsp; Never was a man overtaken 
by more crushing fear.&nbsp; He reeled on the stringer piece, his
face went white to the roots of his hair, and he seemed to shrink
and wither away inside his clothes.&nbsp; He threw up his hands 
and groaned, &ldquo;My God!&nbsp; My God!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he 
controlled himself by a great effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Lucy!&nbsp; Good-bye!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>And he stood there on the wharf, waving his hands to her till 
the <i>Noeau</i> was clear away and the faces lining her 
after-rail were vague and indistinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you knew,&rdquo; said McVeigh, who had been 
regarding him curiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You, of all men, should 
have known.&nbsp; I thought that was why you were 
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know now,&rdquo; Kersdale answered with immense 
gravity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the carriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked rapidly&mdash;half-ran&mdash;to it.&nbsp; I had to 
half-run myself to keep up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive to Doctor Hervey&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he told the 
driver.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drive as fast as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank down in a seat, panting and gasping.&nbsp; The pallor 
of his face had increased.&nbsp; His lips were compressed and the
sweat was standing out on his forehead and upper lip.&nbsp; He 
seemed in some horrible agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Martin, make those horses 
go!&rdquo; he broke out suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lay the whip into 
them!&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;lay the whip into them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll break, sir,&rdquo; the driver 
remonstrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them break,&rdquo; Kersdale answered.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay your fine and square you with the 
police.&nbsp; Put it to them.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; 
Faster!&nbsp; Faster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I never knew, I never knew,&rdquo; he muttered, 
sinking back in the seat and with trembling hands wiping the 
sweat away.</p>
<p>The carriage was bouncing, swaying and lurching around corners
at such a wild pace as to make conversation impossible.&nbsp; 
Besides, there was nothing to say.&nbsp; But I could hear him 
muttering over and over, &ldquo;And I never knew.&nbsp; I never 
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>ALOHA OE</h2>
<p>Never are there such departures as from the dock at 
Honolulu.&nbsp; The great transport lay with steam up, ready to 
pull out.&nbsp; A thousand persons were on her decks; five 
thousand stood on the wharf.&nbsp; Up and down the long gangway 
passed native princes and princesses, sugar kings and the high 
officials of the Territory.&nbsp; Beyond, in long lines, kept in 
order by the native police, were the carriages and motor-cars of 
the Honolulu aristocracy.&nbsp; On the wharf the Royal Hawaiian 
Band played &ldquo;Aloha Oe,&rdquo; and when it finished, a 
stringed orchestra of native musicians on board the transport 
took up the same sobbing strains, the native woman singer&rsquo;s
voice rising birdlike above the instruments and the hubbub of 
departure.&nbsp; It was a silver reed, sounding its clear, 
unmistakable note in the great diapason of farewell.</p>
<p>Forward, on the lower deck, the rail was lined six deep with 
khaki-clad young boys, whose bronzed faces told of three 
years&rsquo; campaigning under the sun.&nbsp; But the farewell 
was not for them.&nbsp; Nor was it for the white-clad captain on 
the lofty bridge, remote as the stars, gazing down upon the 
tumult beneath him.&nbsp; Nor was the farewell for the young 
officers farther aft, returning from the Philippines, nor for the
white-faced, climate-ravaged women by their sides.&nbsp; Just aft
the gangway, on the promenade deck, stood a score of United 
States Senators with their wives and daughters&mdash;the 
Senatorial junketing party that for a month had been dined and 
wined, surfeited with statistics and dragged up volcanic hill and
down lava dale to behold the glories and resources of 
Hawaii.&nbsp; It was for the junketing party that the transport 
had called in at Honolulu, and it was to the junketing party that
Honolulu was saying good-bye.</p>
<p>The Senators were garlanded and bedecked with flowers.&nbsp; 
Senator Jeremy Sambrooke&rsquo;s stout neck and portly bosom were
burdened with a dozen wreaths.&nbsp; Out of this mass of bloom 
and blossom projected his head and the greater portion of his 
freshly sunburned and perspiring face.&nbsp; He thought the 
flowers an abomination, and as he looked out over the multitude 
on the wharf it was with a statistical eye that saw none of the 
beauty, but that peered into the labour power, the factories, the
railroads, and the plantations that lay back of the multitude and
which the multitude expressed.&nbsp; He saw resources and thought
development, and he was too busy with dreams of material 
achievement and empire to notice his daughter at his side, 
talking with a young fellow in a natty summer suit and straw hat,
whose eager eyes seemed only for her and never left her 
face.&nbsp; Had Senator Jeremy had eyes for his daughter, he 
would have seen that, in place of the young girl of fifteen he 
had brought to Hawaii a short month before, he was now taking 
away with him a woman.</p>
<p>Hawaii has a ripening climate, and Dorothy Sambrooke had been 
exposed to it under exceptionally ripening circumstances.&nbsp; 
Slender, pale, with blue eyes a trifle tired from poring over the
pages of books and trying to muddle into an understanding of 
life&mdash;such she had been the month before.&nbsp; But now the 
eyes were warm instead of tired, the cheeks were touched with the
sun, and the body gave the first hint and promise of swelling 
lines.&nbsp; During that month she had left books alone, for she 
had found greater joy in reading from the book of life.&nbsp; She
had ridden horses, climbed volcanoes, and learned surf 
swimming.&nbsp; The tropics had entered into her blood, and she 
was aglow with the warmth and colour and sunshine.&nbsp; And for 
a month she had been in the company of a man&mdash;Stephen 
Knight, athlete, surf-board rider, a bronzed god of the sea who 
bitted the crashing breakers, leaped upon their backs, and rode 
them in to shore.</p>
<p>Dorothy Sambrooke was unaware of the change.&nbsp; Her 
consciousness was still that of a young girl, and she was 
surprised and troubled by Steve&rsquo;s conduct in this hour of 
saying good-bye.&nbsp; She had looked upon him as her playfellow,
and for the month he had been her playfellow; but now he was not 
parting like a playfellow.&nbsp; He talked excitedly and 
disconnectedly, or was silent, by fits and starts.&nbsp; 
Sometimes he did not hear what she was saying, or if he did, 
failed to respond in his wonted manner.&nbsp; She was perturbed 
by the way he looked at her.&nbsp; She had not known before that 
he had such blazing eyes.&nbsp; There was something in his eyes 
that was terrifying.&nbsp; She could not face it, and her own 
eyes continually drooped before it.&nbsp; Yet there was something
alluring about it, as well, and she continually returned to catch
a glimpse of that blazing, imperious, yearning something that she
had never seen in human eyes before.&nbsp; And she was herself 
strangely bewildered and excited.</p>
<p>The transport&rsquo;s huge whistle blew a deafening blast, and
the flower-crowned multitude surged closer to the side of the 
dock.&nbsp; Dorothy Sambrooke&rsquo;s fingers were pressed to her
ears; and as she made a <i>moue</i> of distaste at the outrage of
sound, she noticed again the imperious, yearning blaze in 
Steve&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; He was not looking at her, but at her 
ears, delicately pink and transparent in the slanting rays of the
afternoon sun.&nbsp; Curious and fascinated, she gazed at that 
strange something in his eyes until he saw that he had been 
caught.&nbsp; She saw his cheeks flush darkly and heard him utter
inarticulately.&nbsp; He was embarrassed, and she was aware of 
embarrassment herself.&nbsp; Stewards were going about nervously 
begging shore-going persons to be gone.&nbsp; Steve put out his 
hand.&nbsp; When she felt the grip of the fingers that had 
gripped hers a thousand times on surf-boards and lava slopes, she
heard the words of the song with a new understanding as they 
sobbed in the Hawaiian woman&rsquo;s silver throat:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ka halia ko aloha kai hiki mai,<br />
Ke hone ae nei i ku&rsquo;u manawa,<br />
O oe no kan aloha<br />
A loko e hana nei.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steve had taught her air and words and meaning&mdash;so she 
had thought, till this instant; and in this instant of the last 
finger clasp and warm contact of palms she divined for the first 
time the real meaning of the song.&nbsp; She scarcely saw him go,
nor could she note him on the crowded gangway, for she was deep 
in a memory maze, living over the four weeks just past, rereading
events in the light of revelation.</p>
<p>When the Senatorial party had landed, Steve had been one of 
the committee of entertainment.&nbsp; It was he who had given 
them their first exhibition of surf riding, out at Waikiki Beach,
paddling his narrow board seaward until he became a disappearing 
speck, and then, suddenly reappearing, rising like a sea-god from
out of the welter of spume and churning white&mdash;rising 
swiftly higher and higher, shoulders and chest and loins and 
limbs, until he stood poised on the smoking crest of a mighty, 
mile-long billow, his feet buried in the flying foam, hurling 
beach-ward with the speed of an express train and stepping calmly
ashore at their astounded feet.&nbsp; That had been her first 
glimpse of Steve.&nbsp; He had been the youngest man on the 
committee, a youth, himself, of twenty.&nbsp; He had not 
entertained by speechmaking, nor had he shone decoratively at 
receptions.&nbsp; It was in the breakers at Waikiki, in the wild 
cattle drive on Manna Kea, and in the breaking yard of the 
Haleakala Ranch that he had performed his share of the 
entertaining.</p>
<p>She had not cared for the interminable statistics and eternal 
speechmaking of the other members of the committee.&nbsp; Neither
had Steve.&nbsp; And it was with Steve that she had stolen away 
from the open-air feast at Hamakua, and from Abe Louisson, the 
coffee planter, who had talked coffee, coffee, nothing but 
coffee, for two mortal hours.&nbsp; It was then, as they rode 
among the tree ferns, that Steve had taught her the words of 
&ldquo;Aloha Oe,&rdquo; the song that had been sung to the 
visiting Senators at every village, ranch, and plantation 
departure.</p>
<p>Steve and she had been much together from the first.&nbsp; He 
had been her playfellow.&nbsp; She had taken possession of him 
while her father had been occupied in taking possession of the 
statistics of the island territory.&nbsp; She was too gentle to 
tyrannize over her playfellow, yet she had ruled him abjectly, 
except when in canoe, or on horse or surf-board, at which times 
he had taken charge and she had rendered obedience.&nbsp; And 
now, with this last singing of the song, as the lines were cast 
off and the big transport began backing slowly out from the dock,
she knew that Steve was something more to her than 
playfellow.</p>
<p>Five thousand voices were singing &ldquo;Aloha 
Oe,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>My love be with you till we meet 
again</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and in that first moment of known love 
she realized that she and Steve were being torn apart.&nbsp; When
would they ever meet again?&nbsp; He had taught her those words 
himself.&nbsp; She remembered listening as he sang them over and 
over under the <i>hau</i> tree at Waikiki.&nbsp; Had it been 
prophecy?&nbsp; And she had admired his singing, had told him 
that he sang with such expression.&nbsp; She laughed aloud, 
hysterically, at the recollection.&nbsp; With such 
expression!&mdash;when he had been pouring his heart out in his 
voice.&nbsp; She knew now, and it was too late.&nbsp; Why had he 
not spoken?&nbsp; Then she realized that girls of her age did not
marry.&nbsp; But girls of her age did marry&mdash;in 
Hawaii&mdash;was her instant thought.&nbsp; Hawaii had ripened 
her&mdash;Hawaii, where flesh is golden and where all women are 
ripe and sun-kissed.</p>
<p>Vainly she scanned the packed multitude on the dock.&nbsp; 
What had become of him?&nbsp; She felt she could pay any price 
for one more glimpse of him, and she almost hoped that some 
mortal sickness would strike the lonely captain on the bridge and
delay departure.&nbsp; For the first time in her life she looked 
at her father with a calculating eye, and as she did she noted 
with newborn fear the lines of will and determination.&nbsp; It 
would be terrible to oppose him.&nbsp; And what chance would she 
have in such a struggle?&nbsp; But why had Steve not 
spoken?&nbsp; Now it was too late.&nbsp; Why had he not spoken 
under the <i>hau</i> tree at Waikiki?</p>
<p>And then, with a great sinking of the heart, it came to her 
that she knew why.&nbsp; What was it she had heard one day?&nbsp;
Oh, yes, it was at Mrs. Stanton&rsquo;s tea, that afternoon when 
the ladies of the &ldquo;Missionary Crowd&rdquo; had entertained 
the ladies of the Senatorial party.&nbsp; It was Mrs. Hodgkins, 
the tall blonde woman, who had asked the question.&nbsp; The 
scene came back to her vividly&mdash;the broad <i>lanai</i>, the 
tropic flowers, the noiseless Asiatic attendants, the hum of the 
voices of the many women and the question Mrs. Hodgkins had asked
in the group next to her.&nbsp; Mrs. Hodgkins had been away on 
the mainland for years, and was evidently inquiring after old 
island friends of her maiden days.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has become 
of Susie Maydwell?&rdquo; was the question she had asked.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh, we never see her any more; she married Willie 
Kupele,&rdquo; another island woman answered.&nbsp; And Senator 
Behrend&rsquo;s wife laughed and wanted to know why matrimony had
affected Susie Maydwell&rsquo;s friendships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hapa-haole</i>,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;he was
a half-caste, you know, and we of the Islands have to think about
our children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy turned to her father, resolved to put it to the 
test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, if Steve ever comes to the United States, 
mayn&rsquo;t he come and see us some time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&nbsp; Steve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Stephen Knight&mdash;you know him.&nbsp; You said 
good-bye to him not five minutes ago.&nbsp; Mayn&rsquo;t he, if 
he happens to be in the United States some time, come and see 
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Jeremy Sambrooke answered 
shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stephen Knight is a <i>hapa-haole</i> and 
you know what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dorothy said faintly, while she felt a numb 
despair creep into her heart.</p>
<p>Steve was not a <i>hapa-haole</i>&mdash;she knew that; but she
did not know that a quarter-strain of tropic sunshine streamed in
his veins, and she knew that that was sufficient to put him 
outside the marriage pale.&nbsp; It was a strange world.&nbsp; 
There was the Honourable A. S. Cleghorn, who had married a dusky 
princess of the Kamehameha blood, yet men considered it an honour
to know him, and the most exclusive women of the ultra-exclusive 
&ldquo;Missionary Crowd&rdquo; were to be seen at his afternoon 
teas.&nbsp; And there was Steve.&nbsp; No one had disapproved of 
his teaching her to ride a surf-board, nor of his leading her by 
the hand through the perilous places of the crater of 
Kilauea.&nbsp; He could have dinner with her and her father, 
dance with her, and be a member of the entertainment committee; 
but because there was tropic sunshine in his veins he could not 
marry her.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t show it.&nbsp; One had to be told to 
know.&nbsp; And he was so good-looking.&nbsp; The picture of him 
limned itself on her inner vision, and before she was aware she 
was pleasuring in the memory of the grace of his magnificent 
body, of his splendid shoulders, of the power in him that tossed 
her lightly on a horse, bore her safely through the thundering 
breakers, or towed her at the end of an alpenstock up the stern 
lava crest of the House of the Sun.&nbsp; There was something 
subtler and mysterious that she remembered, and that she was even
then just beginning to understand&mdash;the aura of the male 
creature that is man, all man, masculine man.&nbsp; She came to 
herself with a shock of shame at the thoughts she had been 
thinking.&nbsp; Her cheeks were dyed with the hot blood which 
quickly receded and left them pale at the thought that she would 
never see him again.&nbsp; The stem of the transport was already 
out in the stream, and the promenade deck was passing abreast of 
the end of the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Steve now,&rdquo; her father said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Wave good-bye to him, Dorothy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve was looking up at her with eager eyes, and he saw in her
face what he had not seen before.&nbsp; By the rush of gladness 
into his own face she knew that he knew.&nbsp; The air was 
throbbing with the song&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My love to you.<br />
My love be with you till we meet again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no need for speech to tell their story.&nbsp; About 
her, passengers were flinging their garlands to their friends on 
the dock.&nbsp; Steve held up his hands and his eyes 
pleaded.&nbsp; She slipped her own garland over her head, but it 
had become entangled in the string of Oriental pearls that 
Mervin, an elderly sugar king, had placed around her neck when he
drove her and her father down to the steamer.</p>
<p>She fought with the pearls that clung to the flowers.&nbsp; 
The transport was moving steadily on.&nbsp; Steve was already 
beneath her.&nbsp; This was the moment.&nbsp; The next moment and
he would be past.&nbsp; She sobbed, and Jeremy Sambrooke glanced 
at her inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo; he cried sharply.</p>
<p>She deliberately snapped the string, and, amid a shower of 
pearls, the flowers fell to the waiting lover.&nbsp; She gazed at
him until the tears blinded her and she buried her face on the 
shoulder of Jeremy Sambrooke, who forgot his beloved statistics 
in wonderment at girl babies that insisted on growing up.&nbsp; 
The crowd sang on, the song growing fainter in the distance, but 
still melting with the sensuous love-languor of Hawaii, the words
biting into her heart like acid because of their untruth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Aloha oe, Aloha oe, e ke onaona no ho ika lipo,<br
/>
A fond embrace, ahoi ae au, until we meet again.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHUN AH CHUN</h2>
<p>There was nothing striking in the appearance of Chun Ah 
Chun.&nbsp; He was rather undersized, as Chinese go, and the 
Chinese narrow shoulders and spareness of flesh were his.&nbsp; 
The average tourist, casually glimpsing him on the streets of 
Honolulu, would have concluded that he was a good-natured little 
Chinese, probably the proprietor of a prosperous laundry or 
tailorshop.&nbsp; In so far as good nature and prosperity went, 
the judgment would be correct, though beneath the mark; for Ah 
Chun was as good-natured as he was prosperous, and of the latter 
no man knew a tithe the tale.&nbsp; It was well known that he was
enormously wealthy, but in his case &ldquo;enormous&rdquo; was 
merely the symbol for the unknown.</p>
<p>Ah Chun had shrewd little eyes, black and beady and so very 
little that they were like gimlet-holes.&nbsp; But they were wide
apart, and they sheltered under a forehead that was patently the 
forehead of a thinker.&nbsp; For Ah Chun had his problems, and 
had had them all his life.&nbsp; Not that he ever worried over 
them.&nbsp; He was essentially a philosopher, and whether as 
coolie, or multi-millionaire and master of many men, his poise of
soul was the same.&nbsp; He lived always in the high equanimity 
of spiritual repose, undeterred by good fortune, unruffled by ill
fortune.&nbsp; All things went well with him, whether they were 
blows from the overseer in the cane field or a slump in the price
of sugar when he owned those cane fields himself.&nbsp; Thus, 
from the steadfast rock of his sure content he mastered problems 
such as are given to few men to consider, much less to a Chinese 
peasant.</p>
<p>He was precisely that&mdash;a Chinese peasant, born to labour 
in the fields all his days like a beast, but fated to escape from
the fields like the prince in a fairy tale.&nbsp; Ah Chun did not
remember his father, a small farmer in a district not far from 
Canton; nor did he remember much of his mother, who had died when
he was six.&nbsp; But he did remember his respected uncle, Ah 
Kow, for him had he served as a slave from his sixth year to his 
twenty-fourth.&nbsp; It was then that he escaped by contracting 
himself as a coolie to labour for three years on the sugar 
plantations of Hawaii for fifty cents a day.</p>
<p>Ah Chun was observant.&nbsp; He perceived little details that 
not one man in a thousand ever noticed.&nbsp; Three years he 
worked in the field, at the end of which time he knew more about 
cane-growing than the overseers or even the superintendent, while
the superintendent would have been astounded at the knowledge the
weazened little coolie possessed of the reduction processes in 
the mill.&nbsp; But Ah Chun did not study only sugar 
processes.&nbsp; He studied to find out how men came to be owners
of sugar mills and plantations.&nbsp; One judgment he achieved 
early, namely, that men did not become rich from the labour of 
their own hands.&nbsp; He knew, for he had laboured for a score 
of years himself.&nbsp; The men who grew rich did so from the 
labour of the hands of others.&nbsp; That man was richest who had
the greatest number of his fellow creatures toiling for him.</p>
<p>So, when his term of contract was up, Ah Chun invested his 
savings in a small importing store, going into partnership with 
one, Ah Yung.&nbsp; The firm ultimately became the great one of 
&ldquo;Ah Chun and Ah Yung,&rdquo; which handled anything from 
India silks and ginseng to guano islands and blackbird 
brigs.&nbsp; In the meantime, Ah Chun hired out as cook.&nbsp; He
was a good cook, and in three years he was the highest-paid chef 
in Honolulu.&nbsp; His career was assured, and he was a fool to 
abandon it, as Dantin, his employer, told him; but Ah Chun knew 
his own mind best, and for knowing it was called a triple-fool 
and given a present of fifty dollars over and above the wages due
him.</p>
<p>The firm of Ah Chun and Ah Yung was prospering.&nbsp; There 
was no need for Ah Chun longer to be a cook.&nbsp; There were 
boom times in Hawaii.&nbsp; Sugar was being extensively planted, 
and labour was needed.&nbsp; Ah Chun saw the chance, and went 
into the labour-importing business.&nbsp; He brought thousands of
Cantonese coolies into Hawaii, and his wealth began to 
grow.&nbsp; He made investments.&nbsp; His beady black eyes saw 
bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.&nbsp; He bought a 
fish-pond for a song, which later paid five hundred per cent and 
was the opening wedge by which he monopolized the fish market of 
Honolulu.&nbsp; He did not talk for publication, nor figure in 
politics, nor play at revolutions, but he forecast events more 
clearly and farther ahead than did the men who engineered 
them.&nbsp; In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw Honolulu a modern, 
electric-lighted city at a time when it straggled, unkempt and 
sand-tormented, over a barren reef of uplifted coral rock.&nbsp; 
So he bought land.&nbsp; He bought land from merchants who needed
ready cash, from impecunious natives, from riotous traders&rsquo;
sons, from widows and orphans and the lepers deported to Molokai;
and, somehow, as the years went by, the pieces of land he had 
bought proved to be needed for warehouses, or coffee buildings, 
or hotels.&nbsp; He leased, and rented, sold and bought, and 
resold again.</p>
<p>But there were other things as well.&nbsp; He put his 
confidence and his money into Parkinson, the renegade captain 
whom nobody would trust.&nbsp; And Parkinson sailed away on 
mysterious voyages in the little <i>Vega</i>.&nbsp; Parkinson was
taken care of until he died, and years afterward Honolulu was 
astonished when the news leaked out that the Drake and Acorn 
guano islands had been sold to the British Phosphate Trust for 
three-quarters of a million.&nbsp; Then there were the fat, lush 
days of King Kalakaua, when Ah Chun paid three hundred thousand 
dollars for the opium licence.&nbsp; If he paid a third of a 
million for the drug monopoly, the investment was nevertheless a 
good one, for the dividends bought him the Kalalau Plantation, 
which, in turn, paid him thirty per cent for seventeen years and 
was ultimately sold by him for a million and a half.</p>
<p>It was under the Kamehamehas, long before, that he had served 
his own country as Chinese Consul&mdash;a position that was not 
altogether unlucrative; and it was under Kamehameha IV that he 
changed his citizenship, becoming an Hawaiian subject in order to
marry Stella Allendale, herself a subject of the brown-skinned 
king, though more of Anglo-Saxon blood ran in her veins than of 
Polynesian.&nbsp; In fact, the random breeds in her were so 
attenuated that they were valued at eighths and sixteenths.&nbsp;
In the latter proportions was the blood of her great-grandmother,
Paahao&mdash;the Princess Paahao, for she came of the royal 
line.&nbsp; Stella Allendale&rsquo;s great-grandfather had been a
Captain Blunt, an English adventurer who took service under 
Kamehameha I and was made a tabu chief himself.&nbsp; Her 
grandfather had been a New Bedford whaling captain, while through
her own father had been introduced a remote blend of Italian and 
Portuguese which had been grafted upon his own English 
stock.&nbsp; Legally a Hawaiian, Ah Chun&rsquo;s spouse was more 
of any one of three other nationalities.</p>
<p>And into this conglomerate of the races, Ah Chun introduced 
the Mongolian mixture.&nbsp; Thus, his children by Mrs. Ah Chun 
were one thirty-second Polynesian, one-sixteenth Italian, one 
sixteenth Portuguese, one-half Chinese, and eleven thirty-seconds
English and American.&nbsp; It might well be that Ah Chun would 
have refrained from matrimony could he have foreseen the 
wonderful family that was to spring from this union.&nbsp; It was
wonderful in many ways.&nbsp; First, there was its size.&nbsp; 
There were fifteen sons and daughters, mostly daughters.&nbsp; 
The sons had come first, three of them, and then had followed, in
unswerving sequence, a round dozen of girls.&nbsp; The blend of 
the race was excellent.&nbsp; Not alone fruitful did it prove, 
for the progeny, without exception, was healthy and without 
blemish.&nbsp; But the most amazing thing about the family was 
its beauty.&nbsp; All the girls were beautiful&mdash;delicately, 
ethereally beautiful.&nbsp; Mamma Ah Chun&rsquo;s rotund lines 
seemed to modify papa Ah Chun&rsquo;s lean angles, so that the 
daughters were willowy without being lathy, round-muscled without
being chubby.&nbsp; In every feature of every face were haunting 
reminiscences of Asia, all manipulated over and disguised by Old 
England, New England, and South of Europe.&nbsp; No observer, 
without information, would have guessed, the heavy Chinese strain
in their veins; nor could any observer, after being informed, 
fail to note immediately the Chinese traces.</p>
<p>As beauties, the Ah Chun girls were something new.&nbsp; 
Nothing like them had been seen before.&nbsp; They resembled 
nothing so much as they resembled one another, and yet each girl 
was sharply individual.&nbsp; There was no mistaking one for 
another.&nbsp; On the other hand, Maud, who was blue-eyed and 
yellow-haired, would remind one instantly of Henrietta, an olive 
brunette with large, languishing dark eyes and hair that was 
blue-black.&nbsp; The hint of resemblance that ran through them 
all, reconciling every differentiation, was Ah Chun&rsquo;s 
contribution.&nbsp; He had furnished the groundwork upon which 
had been traced the blended patterns of the races.&nbsp; He had 
furnished the slim-boned Chinese frame, upon which had been 
builded the delicacies and subtleties of Saxon, Latin, and 
Polynesian flesh.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ah Chun had ideas of her own to which Ah Chun gave 
credence, though never permitting them expression when they 
conflicted with his own philosophic calm.&nbsp; She had been used
all her life to living in European fashion.&nbsp; Very 
well.&nbsp; Ah Chun gave her a European mansion.&nbsp; Later, as 
his sons and daughters grew able to advise, he built a bungalow, 
a spacious, rambling affair, as unpretentious as it was 
magnificent.&nbsp; Also, as time went by, there arose a mountain 
house on Tantalus, to which the family could flee when the 
&ldquo;sick wind&rdquo; blew from the south.&nbsp; And at Waikiki
he built a beach residence on an extensive site so well chosen 
that later on, when the United States government condemned it for
fortification purposes, an immense sum accompanied the 
condemnation.&nbsp; In all his houses were billiard and smoking 
rooms and guest rooms galore, for Ah Chun&rsquo;s wonderful 
progeny was given to lavish entertainment.&nbsp; The furnishing 
was extravagantly simple.&nbsp; Kings&rsquo; ransoms were 
expended without display&mdash;thanks to the educated tastes of 
the progeny.</p>
<p>Ah Chun had been liberal in the matter of education.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Never mind expense,&rdquo; he had argued in the old days 
with Parkinson when that slack mariner could see no reason for 
making the <i>Vega</i> seaworthy; &ldquo;you sail the schooner, I
pay the bills.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so with his sons and 
daughters.&nbsp; It had been for them to get the education and 
never mind the expense.&nbsp; Harold, the eldest-born, had gone 
to Harvard and Oxford; Albert and Charles had gone through Yale 
in the same classes.&nbsp; And the daughters, from the eldest 
down, had undergone their preparation at Mills Seminary in 
California and passed on to Vassar, Wellesley, or Bryn 
Mawr.&nbsp; Several, having so desired, had had the finishing 
touches put on in Europe.&nbsp; And from all the world Ah 
Chun&rsquo;s sons and daughters returned to him to suggest and 
advise in the garnishment of the chaste magnificence of his 
residences.&nbsp; Ah Chun himself preferred the voluptuous 
glitter of Oriental display; but he was a philosopher, and he 
clearly saw that his children&rsquo;s tastes were correct 
according to Western standards.</p>
<p>Of course, his children were not known as the Ah Chun 
children.&nbsp; As he had evolved from a coolie labourer to a 
multi-millionaire, so had his name evolved.&nbsp; Mamma Ah Chun 
had spelled it A&rsquo;Chun, but her wiser offspring had elided 
the apostrophe and spelled it Achun.&nbsp; Ah Chun did not 
object.&nbsp; The spelling of his name interfered no whit with 
his comfort nor his philosophic calm.&nbsp; Besides, he was not 
proud.&nbsp; But when his children arose to the height of a 
starched shirt, a stiff collar, and a frock coat, they did 
interfere with his comfort and calm.&nbsp; Ah Chun would have 
none of it.&nbsp; He preferred the loose-flowing robes of China, 
and neither could they cajole nor bully him into making the 
change.&nbsp; They tried both courses, and in the latter one 
failed especially disastrously.&nbsp; They had not been to 
America for nothing.&nbsp; They had learned the virtues of the 
boycott as employed by organized labour, and he, their father, 
Chun Ah Chun, they boycotted in his own house, Mamma Achun aiding
and abetting.&nbsp; But Ah Chun himself, while unversed in 
Western culture, was thoroughly conversant with Western labour 
conditions.&nbsp; An extensive employer of labour himself, he 
knew how to cope with its tactics.&nbsp; Promptly he imposed a 
lockout on his rebellious progeny and erring spouse.&nbsp; He 
discharged his scores of servants, locked up his stables, closed 
his houses, and went to live in the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, in 
which enterprise he happened to be the heaviest 
stockholder.&nbsp; The family fluttered distractedly on visits 
about with friends, while Ah Chun calmly managed his many 
affairs, smoked his long pipe with the tiny silver bowl, and 
pondered the problem of his wonderful progeny.</p>
<p>This problem did not disturb his calm.&nbsp; He knew in his 
philosopher&rsquo;s soul that when it was ripe he would solve 
it.&nbsp; In the meantime he enforced the lesson that complacent 
as he might be, he was nevertheless the absolute dictator of the 
Achun destinies.&nbsp; The family held out for a week, then 
returned, along with Ah Chun and the many servants, to occupy the
bungalow once more.&nbsp; And thereafter no question was raised 
when Ah Chun elected to enter his brilliant drawing-room in blue 
silk robe, wadded slippers, and black silk skull-cap with red 
button peak, or when he chose to draw at his slender-stemmed 
silver-bowled pipe among the cigarette-and cigar-smoking officers
and civilians on the broad verandas or in the smoking room.</p>
<p>Ah Chun occupied a unique position in Honolulu.&nbsp; Though 
he did not appear in society, he was eligible anywhere.&nbsp; 
Except among the Chinese merchants of the city, he never went 
out; but he received, and he always was the centre of his 
household and the head of his table.&nbsp; Himself peasant, born 
Chinese, he presided over an atmosphere of culture and refinement
second to none in all the islands.&nbsp; Nor were there any in 
all the islands too proud to cross his threshold and enjoy his 
hospitality.&nbsp; First of all, the Achun bungalow was of 
irreproachable tone.&nbsp; Next, Ah Chun was a power.&nbsp; And 
finally, Ah Chun was a moral paragon and an honest business 
man.&nbsp; Despite the fact that business morality was higher 
than on the mainland, Ah Chun outshone the business men of 
Honolulu in the scrupulous rigidity of his honesty.&nbsp; It was 
a saying that his word was as good as his bond.&nbsp; His 
signature was never needed to bind him.&nbsp; He never broke his 
word.&nbsp; Twenty years after Hotchkiss, of Hotchkiss, Morterson
Company, died, they found among mislaid papers a memorandum of a 
loan of thirty thousand dollars to Ah Chun.&nbsp; It had been 
incurred when Ah Chun was Privy Councillor to Kamehameha 
II.&nbsp; In the bustle and confusion of those heyday, 
money-making times, the affair had slipped Ah Chun&rsquo;s 
mind.&nbsp; There was no note, no legal claim against him, but he
settled in full with the Hotchkiss&rsquo; Estate, voluntarily 
paying a compound interest that dwarfed the principal.&nbsp; 
Likewise, when he verbally guaranteed the disastrous Kakiku Ditch
Scheme, at a time when the least sanguine did not dream a 
guarantee necessary&mdash;&ldquo;Signed his cheque for two 
hundred thousand without a quiver, gentlemen, without a 
quiver,&rdquo; was the report of the secretary of the defunct 
enterprise, who had been sent on the forlorn hope of finding out 
Ah Chun&rsquo;s intentions.&nbsp; And on top of the many similar 
actions that were true of his word, there was scarcely a man of 
repute in the islands that at one time or another had not 
experienced the helping financial hand of Ah Chun.</p>
<p>So it was that Honolulu watched his wonderful family grow up 
into a perplexing problem and secretly sympathized with him, for 
it was beyond any of them to imagine what he was going to do with
it.&nbsp; But Ah Chun saw the problem more clearly than 
they.&nbsp; No one knew as he knew the extent to which he was an 
alien in his family.&nbsp; His own family did not guess it.&nbsp;
He saw that there was no place for him amongst this marvellous 
seed of his loins, and he looked forward to his declining years 
and knew that he would grow more and more alien.&nbsp; He did not
understand his children.&nbsp; Their conversation was of things 
that did not interest him and about which he knew nothing.&nbsp; 
The culture of the West had passed him by.&nbsp; He was Asiatic 
to the last fibre, which meant that he was heathen.&nbsp; Their 
Christianity was to him so much nonsense.&nbsp; But all this he 
would have ignored as extraneous and irrelevant, could he have 
but understood the young people themselves.&nbsp; When Maud, for 
instance, told him that the housekeeping bills for the month were
thirty thousand&mdash;that he understood, as he understood 
Albert&rsquo;s request for five thousand with which to buy the 
schooner yacht <i>Muriel</i> and become a member of the Hawaiian 
Yacht Club.&nbsp; But it was their remoter, complicated desires 
and mental processes that obfuscated him.&nbsp; He was not slow 
in learning that the mind of each son and daughter was a secret 
labyrinth which he could never hope to tread.&nbsp; Always he 
came upon the wall that divides East from West.&nbsp; Their souls
were inaccessible to him, and by the same token he knew that his 
soul was inaccessible to them.</p>
<p>Besides, as the years came upon him, he found himself harking 
back more and more to his own kind.&nbsp; The reeking smells of 
the Chinese quarter were spicy to him.&nbsp; He sniffed them with
satisfaction as he passed along the street, for in his mind they 
carried him back to the narrow tortuous alleys of Canton swarming
with life and movement.&nbsp; He regretted that he had cut off 
his queue to please Stella Allendale in the prenuptial days, and 
he seriously considered the advisability of shaving his crown and
growing a new one.&nbsp; The dishes his highly paid chef 
concocted for him failed to tickle his reminiscent palate in the 
way that the weird messes did in the stuffy restaurant down in 
the Chinese quarter.&nbsp; He enjoyed vastly more a 
half-hour&rsquo;s smoke and chat with two or three Chinese chums,
than to preside at the lavish and elegant dinners for which his 
bungalow was famed, where the pick of the Americans and Europeans
sat at the long table, men and women on equality, the women with 
jewels that blazed in the subdued light against white necks and 
arms, the men in evening dress, and all chattering and laughing 
over topics and witticisms that, while they were not exactly 
Greek to him, did not interest him nor entertain.</p>
<p>But it was not merely his alienness and his growing desire to 
return to his Chinese flesh-pots that constituted the 
problem.&nbsp; There was also his wealth.&nbsp; He had looked 
forward to a placid old age.&nbsp; He had worked hard.&nbsp; His 
reward should have been peace and repose.&nbsp; But he knew that 
with his immense fortune peace and repose could not possibly be 
his.&nbsp; Already there were signs and omens.&nbsp; He had seen 
similar troubles before.&nbsp; There was his old employer, 
Dantin, whose children had wrested from him, by due process of 
law, the management of his property, having the Court appoint 
guardians to administer it for him.&nbsp; Ah Chun knew, and knew 
thoroughly well, that had Dantin been a poor man, it would have 
been found that he could quite rationally manage his own 
affairs.&nbsp; And old Dantin had had only three children and 
half a million, while he, Chun Ah Chun, had fifteen children and 
no one but himself knew how many millions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our daughters are beautiful women,&rdquo; he said to 
his wife, one evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are many young 
men.&nbsp; The house is always full of young men.&nbsp; My cigar 
bills are very heavy.&nbsp; Why are there no 
marriages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamma Achun shrugged her shoulders and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are women and men are men&mdash;it is strange 
there are no marriages.&nbsp; Perhaps the young men do not like 
our daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, they like them well enough,&rdquo; Mamma Chun 
answered; &ldquo;but you see, they cannot forget that you are 
your daughters&rsquo; father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you forgot who my father was,&rdquo; Ah Chun said 
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;All you asked was for me to cut off my 
queue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young men are more particular than I was, I 
fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the greatest thing in the world?&rdquo; Ah Chun
demanded with abrupt irrelevance.</p>
<p>Mamma Achun pondered for a moment, then replied:&nbsp; 
&ldquo;God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are gods and gods.&nbsp; Some 
are paper, some are wood, some are bronze.&nbsp; I use a small 
one in the office for a paper-weight.&nbsp; In the Bishop Museum 
are many gods of coral rock and lava stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is only one God,&rdquo; she announced 
decisively, stiffening her ample frame argumentatively.</p>
<p>Ah Chun noted the danger signal and sheered off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is greater than God, then?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I will tell you.&nbsp; It is money.&nbsp; In my time I 
have had dealings with Jews and Christians, Mohammedans and 
Buddhists, and with little black men from the Solomons and New 
Guinea who carried their god about them, wrapped in oiled 
paper.&nbsp; They possessed various gods, these men, but they all
worshipped money.&nbsp; There is that Captain Higginson.&nbsp; He
seems to like Henrietta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will never marry her,&rdquo; retorted Mamma 
Achun.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will be an admiral before he 
dies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rear-admiral,&rdquo; Ah Chun interpolated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&nbsp; That is the way they 
retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His family in the United States is a high one.&nbsp; 
They would not like it if he married . . . if he did not marry an
American girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah Chun knocked the ashes out of his pipe, thoughtfully 
refilling the silver bowl with a tiny pleget of tobacco.&nbsp; He
lighted it and smoked it out before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henrietta is the oldest girl.&nbsp; The day she marries
I will give her three hundred thousand dollars.&nbsp; That will 
fetch that Captain Higginson and his high family along with 
him.&nbsp; Let the word go out to him.&nbsp; I leave it to 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ah Chun sat and smoked on, and in the curling 
smoke-wreaths he saw take shape the face and figure of Toy 
Shuey&mdash;Toy Shuey, the maid of all work in his uncle&rsquo;s 
house in the Cantonese village, whose work was never done and who
received for a whole year&rsquo;s work one dollar.&nbsp; And he 
saw his youthful self arise in the curling smoke, his youthful 
self who had toiled eighteen years in his uncle&rsquo;s field for
little more.&nbsp; And now he, Ah Chun, the peasant, dowered his 
daughter with three hundred thousand years of such toil.&nbsp; 
And she was but one daughter of a dozen.&nbsp; He was not elated 
at the thought.&nbsp; It struck him that it was a funny, 
whimsical world, and he chuckled aloud and startled Mamma Achun 
from a revery which he knew lay deep in the hidden crypts of her 
being where he had never penetrated.</p>
<p>But Ah Chun&rsquo;s word went forth, as a whisper, and Captain
Higginson forgot his rear-admiralship and his high family and 
took to wife three hundred thousand dollars and a refined and 
cultured girl who was one thirty-second Polynesian, one-sixteenth
Italian, one-sixteenth Portuguese, eleven thirty-seconds English 
and Yankee, and one-half Chinese.</p>
<p>Ah Chun&rsquo;s munificence had its effect.&nbsp; His 
daughters became suddenly eligible and desirable.&nbsp; Clara was
the next, but when the Secretary of the Territory formally 
proposed for her, Ah Chun informed him that he must wait his 
turn, that Maud was the oldest and that she must be married 
first.&nbsp; It was shrewd policy.&nbsp; The whole family was 
made vitally interested in marrying off Maud, which it did in 
three months, to Ned Humphreys, the United States immigration 
commissioner.&nbsp; Both he and Maud complained, for the dowry 
was only two hundred thousand.&nbsp; Ah Chun explained that his 
initial generosity had been to break the ice, and that after that
his daughters could not expect otherwise than to go more 
cheaply.</p>
<p>Clara followed Maud, and thereafter, for a space of two years;
there was a continuous round of weddings in the bungalow.&nbsp; 
In the meantime Ah Chun had not been idle.&nbsp; Investment after
investment was called in.&nbsp; He sold out his interests in a 
score of enterprises, and step by step, so as not to cause a 
slump in the market, he disposed of his large holdings in real 
estate.&nbsp; Toward the last he did precipitate a slump and sold
at sacrifice.&nbsp; What caused this haste were the squalls he 
saw already rising above the horizon.&nbsp; By the time Lucille 
was married, echoes of bickerings and jealousies were already 
rumbling in his ears.&nbsp; The air was thick with schemes and 
counter-schemes to gain his favour and to prejudice him against 
one or another or all but one of his sons-in-law.&nbsp; All of 
which was not conducive to the peace and repose he had planned 
for his old age.</p>
<p>He hastened his efforts.&nbsp; For a long time he had been in 
correspondence with the chief banks in Shanghai and Macao.&nbsp; 
Every steamer for several years had carried away drafts drawn in 
favour of one, Chun Ah Chun, for deposit in those Far Eastern 
banks.&nbsp; The drafts now became heavier.&nbsp; His two 
youngest daughters were not yet married.&nbsp; He did not wait, 
but dowered them with a hundred thousand each, which sums lay in 
the Bank of Hawaii, drawing interest and awaiting their wedding 
day.&nbsp; Albert took over the business of the firm of Ah Chun 
and Ah Yung, Harold, the eldest, having elected to take a quarter
of a million and go to England to live.&nbsp; Charles, the 
youngest, took a hundred thousand, a legal guardian, and a course
in a Keeley institute.&nbsp; To Mamma Achun was given the 
bungalow, the mountain House on Tantalus, and a new seaside 
residence in place of the one Ah Chun sold to the 
government.&nbsp; Also, to Mamma Achun was given half a million 
in money well invested.</p>
<p>Ah Chun was now ready to crack the nut of the problem.&nbsp; 
One fine morning when the family was at breakfast&mdash;he had 
seen to it that all his sons-in-law and their wives were 
present&mdash;he announced that he was returning to his ancestral
soil.&nbsp; In a neat little homily he explained that he had made
ample provision for his family, and he laid down various maxims 
that he was sure, he said, would enable them to dwell together in
peace and harmony.&nbsp; Also, he gave business advice to his 
sons-in-law, preached the virtues of temperate living and safe 
investments, and gave them the benefit of his encyclopedic 
knowledge of industrial and business conditions in Hawaii.&nbsp; 
Then he called for his carriage, and, in the company of the 
weeping Mamma Achun, was driven down to the Pacific Mail steamer,
leaving behind him a panic in the bungalow.&nbsp; Captain 
Higginson clamoured wildly for an injunction.&nbsp; The daughters
shed copious tears.&nbsp; One of their husbands, an ex-Federal 
judge, questioned Ah Chun&rsquo;s sanity, and hastened to the 
proper authorities to inquire into it.&nbsp; He returned with the
information that Ah Chun had appeared before the commission the 
day before, demanded an examination, and passed with flying 
colours.&nbsp; There was nothing to be done, so they went down 
and said good-bye to the little old man, who waved farewell from 
the promenade deck as the big steamer poked her nose seaward 
through the coral reef.</p>
<p>But the little old man was not bound for Canton.&nbsp; He knew
his own country too well, and the squeeze of the Mandarins, to 
venture into it with the tidy bulk of wealth that remained to 
him.&nbsp; He went to Macao.&nbsp; Now Ah Chun had long exercised
the power of a king and he was as imperious as a king.&nbsp; When
he landed at Macao and went into the office of the biggest 
European hotel to register, the clerk closed the book on 
him.&nbsp; Chinese were not permitted.&nbsp; Ah Chun called for 
the manager and was treated with contumely.&nbsp; He drove away, 
but in two hours he was back again.&nbsp; He called the clerk and
manager in, gave them a month&rsquo;s salary, and discharged 
them.&nbsp; He had made himself the owner of the hotel; and in 
the finest suite he settled down during the many months the 
gorgeous palace in the suburbs was building for him.&nbsp; In the
meantime, with the inevitable ability that was his, he increased 
the earnings of his big hotel from three per cent to thirty.</p>
<p>The troubles Ah Chun had flown began early.&nbsp; There were 
sons-in-law that made bad investments, others that played ducks 
and drakes with the Achun dowries.&nbsp; Ah Chun being out of it,
they looked at Mamma Ah Chun and her half million, and, looking, 
engendered not the best of feeling toward one another.&nbsp; 
Lawyers waxed fat in the striving to ascertain the construction 
of trust deeds.&nbsp; Suits, cross-suits, and counter-suits 
cluttered the Hawaiian courts.&nbsp; Nor did the police courts 
escape.&nbsp; There were angry encounters in which harsh words 
and harsher blows were struck.&nbsp; There were such things as 
flower pots being thrown to add emphasis to winged words.&nbsp; 
And suits for libel arose that dragged their way through the 
courts and kept Honolulu agog with excitement over the 
revelations of the witnesses.</p>
<p>In his palace, surrounded by all dear delights of the Orient, 
Ah Chun smokes his placid pipe and listens to the turmoil 
overseas.&nbsp; By each mail steamer, in faultless English, 
typewritten on an American machine, a letter goes from Macao to 
Honolulu, in which, by admirable texts and precepts, Ah Chun 
advises his family to live in unity and harmony.&nbsp; As for 
himself, he is out of it all, and well content.&nbsp; He has won 
to peace and repose.&nbsp; At times he chuckles and rubs his 
hands, and his slant little black eyes twinkle merrily at the 
thought of the funny world.&nbsp; For out of all his living and 
philosophizing, that remains to him&mdash;the conviction that it 
is a very funny world.</p>
<h2>THE SHERIFF OF KONA</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot escape liking the climate,&rdquo; Cudworth 
said, in reply to my panegyric on the Kona coast.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
was a young fellow, just out of college, when I came here 
eighteen years ago.&nbsp; I never went back, except, of course, 
to visit.&nbsp; And I warn you, if you have some spot dear to you
on earth, not to linger here too long, else you will find this 
dearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had finished dinner, which had been served on the big 
<i>lanai</i>, the one with a northerly <i>exposure</i>, though 
exposure is indeed a misnomer in so delectable a climate.</p>
<p>The candles had been put out, and a slim, white-clad Japanese 
slipped like a ghost through the silvery moonlight, presented us 
with cigars, and faded away into the darkness of the 
bungalow.&nbsp; I looked through a screen of banana and lehua 
trees, and down across the guava scrub to the quiet sea a 
thousand feet beneath.&nbsp; For a week, ever since I had landed 
from the tiny coasting-steamer, I had been stopping with 
Cudworth, and during that time no wind had ruffled that unvexed 
sea.&nbsp; True, there had been breezes, but they were the 
gentlest zephyrs that ever blew through summer isles.&nbsp; They 
were not winds; they were sighs&mdash;long, balmy sighs of a 
world at rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lotus land,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where each day is like every day, and every day is a 
paradise of days,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing ever 
happens.&nbsp; It is not too hot.&nbsp; It is not too cold.&nbsp;
It is always just right.&nbsp; Have you noticed how the land and 
the sea breathe turn and turn about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, I had noticed that delicious rhythmic, 
breathing.&nbsp; Each morning I had watched the sea-breeze begin 
at the shore and slowly extend seaward as it blew the mildest, 
softest whiff of ozone to the land.&nbsp; It played over the sea,
just faintly darkening its surface, with here and there and 
everywhere long lanes of calm, shifting, changing, drifting, 
according to the capricious kisses of the breeze.&nbsp; And each 
evening I had watched the sea breath die away to heavenly calm, 
and heard the land breath softly make its way through the coffee 
trees and monkey-pods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a land of perpetual calm,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Does it ever blow here?&mdash;ever really blow?&nbsp; You 
know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cudworth shook his head and pointed eastward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can it blow, with a barrier like that to stop 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far above towered the huge bulks of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, 
seeming to blot out half the starry sky.&nbsp; Two miles and a 
half above our heads they reared their own heads, white with snow
that the tropic sun had failed to melt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty miles away, right now, I&rsquo;ll wager, it is 
blowing forty miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled incredulously.</p>
<p>Cudworth stepped to the <i>lanai</i> telephone.&nbsp; He 
called up, in succession, Waimea, Kohala, and Hamakua.&nbsp; 
Snatches of his conversation told me that the wind was 
blowing:&nbsp; &ldquo;Rip-snorting and back-jumping, eh? . . . 
How long? . . . Only a week? . . . Hello, Abe, is that you? . . .
Yes, yes . . . You <i>will</i> plant coffee on the Hamakua coast 
. . . Hang your wind-breaks!&nbsp; You should see <i>my</i> 
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blowing a gale,&rdquo; he said to me, turning from 
hanging up the receiver.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always have to joke Abe 
on his coffee.&nbsp; He has five hundred acres, and he&rsquo;s 
done marvels in wind-breaking, but how he keeps the roots in the 
ground is beyond me.&nbsp; Blow?&nbsp; It always blows on the 
Hamakua side.&nbsp; Kohala reports a schooner under double reefs 
beating up the channel between Hawaii and Maui, and making heavy 
weather of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard to realize,&rdquo; I said lamely.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t a little whiff of it ever eddy around 
somehow, and get down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a whiff.&nbsp; Our land-breeze is absolutely of no 
kin, for it begins this side of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa.&nbsp; 
You see, the land radiates its heat quicker than the sea, and so,
at night, the land breathes over the sea.&nbsp; In the day the 
land becomes warmer than the sea, and the sea breathes over the 
land . . . Listen!&nbsp; Here comes the land-breath now, the 
mountain wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could hear it coming, rustling softly through the coffee 
trees, stirring the monkey-pods, and sighing through the 
sugar-cane.&nbsp; On the <i>lanai</i> the hush still 
reigned.&nbsp; Then it came, the first feel of the mountain wind,
faintly balmy, fragrant and spicy, and cool, deliciously cool, a 
silken coolness, a wine-like coolness&mdash;cool as only the 
mountain wind of Kona can be cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wonder that I lost my heart to Kona eighteen 
years ago?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could never leave 
it now.&nbsp; I think I should die.&nbsp; It would be 
terrible.&nbsp; There was another man who loved it, even as 
I.&nbsp; I think he loved it more, for he was born here on the 
Kona coast.&nbsp; He was a great man, my best friend, my more 
than brother.&nbsp; But he left it, and he did not 
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo; I queried.&nbsp; &ldquo;A 
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cudworth shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor will he ever come back, though his heart will be 
here until he dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and gazed down upon the beachlights of Kailua.&nbsp;
I smoked silently and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was already in love . . . with his wife.&nbsp; Also,
he had three children, and he loved them.&nbsp; They are in 
Honolulu now.&nbsp; The boy is going to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some rash act?&rdquo; I questioned, after a time, 
impatiently.</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither guilty of anything 
criminal, nor charged with anything criminal.&nbsp; He was the 
Sheriff of Kona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You choose to be paradoxical,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it does sound that way,&rdquo; he admitted, 
&ldquo;and that is the perfect hell of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me searchingly for a moment, and then abruptly 
took up the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a leper.&nbsp; No, he was not born with 
it&mdash;no one is born with it; it came upon him.&nbsp; This 
man&mdash;what does it matter?&nbsp; Lyte Gregory was his 
name.&nbsp; Every <i>kamaina</i> knows the story.&nbsp; He was 
straight American stock, but he was built like the chieftains of 
old Hawaii.&nbsp; He stood six feet three.&nbsp; His stripped 
weight was two hundred and twenty pounds, not an ounce of which 
was not clean muscle or bone.&nbsp; He was the strongest man I 
have ever seen.&nbsp; He was an athlete and a giant.&nbsp; He was
a god.&nbsp; He was my friend.&nbsp; And his heart and his soul 
were as big and as fine as his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what you would do if you saw your friend, your
brother, on the slippery lip of a precipice, slipping, slipping, 
and you were able to do nothing.&nbsp; That was just it.&nbsp; I 
could do nothing.&nbsp; I saw it coming, and I could do 
nothing.&nbsp; My God, man, what could I do?&nbsp; There it was, 
malignant and incontestable, the mark of the thing on his 
brow.&nbsp; No one else saw it.&nbsp; It was because I loved him 
so, I do believe, that I alone saw it.&nbsp; I could not credit 
the testimony of my senses.&nbsp; It was too incredibly 
horrible.&nbsp; Yet there it was, on his brow, on his ears.&nbsp;
I had seen it, the slight puff of the earlobes&mdash;oh, so 
imperceptibly slight.&nbsp; I watched it for months.&nbsp; Then, 
next, hoping against hope, the darkening of the skin above both 
eyebrows&mdash;oh, so faint, just like the dimmest touch of 
sunburn.&nbsp; I should have thought it sunburn but that there 
was a shine to it, such an invisible shine, like a little 
highlight seen for a moment and gone the next.&nbsp; I tried to 
believe it was sunburn, only I could not.&nbsp; I knew 
better.&nbsp; No one noticed it but me.&nbsp; No one ever noticed
it except Stephen Kaluna, and I did not know that till 
afterward.&nbsp; But I saw it coming, the whole damnable, 
unnamable awfulness of it; but I refused to think about the 
future.&nbsp; I was afraid.&nbsp; I could not.&nbsp; And of 
nights I cried over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was my friend.&nbsp; We fished sharks on Niihau 
together.&nbsp; We hunted wild cattle on Mauna Kea and Mauna 
Loa.&nbsp; We broke horses and branded steers on the Carter 
Ranch.&nbsp; We hunted goats through Haleakala.&nbsp; He taught 
me diving and surfing until I was nearly as clever as he, and he 
was cleverer than the average Kanaka.&nbsp; I have seen him dive 
in fifteen fathoms, and he could stay down two minutes.&nbsp; He 
was an amphibian and a mountaineer.&nbsp; He could climb wherever
a goat dared climb.&nbsp; He was afraid of nothing.&nbsp; He was 
on the wrecked <i>Luga</i>, and he swam thirty miles in 
thirty-six hours in a heavy sea.&nbsp; He could fight his way out
through breaking combers that would batter you and me to a 
jelly.&nbsp; He was a great, glorious man-god.&nbsp; We went 
through the Revolution together.&nbsp; We were both romantic 
loyalists.&nbsp; He was shot twice and sentenced to death.&nbsp; 
But he was too great a man for the republicans to kill.&nbsp; He 
laughed at them.&nbsp; Later, they gave him honour and made him 
Sheriff of Kona.&nbsp; He was a simple man, a boy that never grew
up.&nbsp; His was no intricate brain pattern.&nbsp; He had no 
twists nor quirks in his mental processes.&nbsp; He went straight
to the point, and his points were always simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was sanguine.&nbsp; Never have I known so 
confident a man, nor a man so satisfied and happy.&nbsp; He did 
not ask anything from life.&nbsp; There was nothing left to be 
desired.&nbsp; For him life had no arrears.&nbsp; He had been 
paid in full, cash down, and in advance.&nbsp; What more could he
possibly desire than that magnificent body, that iron 
constitution, that immunity from all ordinary ills, and that 
lowly wholesomeness of soul?&nbsp; Physically he was 
perfect.&nbsp; He had never been sick in his life.&nbsp; He did 
not know what a headache was.&nbsp; When I was so afflicted he 
used to look at me in wonder, and make me laugh with his clumsy 
attempts at sympathy.&nbsp; He did not understand such a thing as
a headache.&nbsp; He could not understand.&nbsp; Sanguine?&nbsp; 
No wonder.&nbsp; How could he be otherwise with that tremendous 
vitality and incredible health?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to show you what faith he had in his glorious 
star, and, also, what sanction he had for that faith.&nbsp; He 
was a youngster at the time&mdash;I had just met him&mdash;when 
he went into a poker game at Wailuku.&nbsp; There was a big 
German in it, Schultz his name was, and he played a brutal, 
domineering game.&nbsp; He had had a run of luck as well, and he 
was quite insufferable, when Lyte Gregory dropped in and took a 
hand.&nbsp; The very first hand it was Schultz&rsquo;s 
blind.&nbsp; Lyte came in, as well as the others, and Schultz 
raised them out&mdash;all except Lyte.&nbsp; He did not like the 
German&rsquo;s tone, and he raised him back.&nbsp; Schultz raised
in turn, and in turn Lyte raised Schultz.&nbsp; So they went, 
back and forth.&nbsp; The stakes were big.&nbsp; And do you know 
what Lyte held?&nbsp; A pair of kings and three little 
clubs.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t poker.&nbsp; Lyte wasn&rsquo;t 
playing poker.&nbsp; He was playing his optimism.&nbsp; He 
didn&rsquo;t know what Schultz held, but he raised and raised 
until he made Schultz squeal, and Schultz held three aces all the
time.&nbsp; Think of it!&nbsp; A man with a pair of kings 
compelling three aces to see before the draw!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Schultz called for two cards.&nbsp; Another 
German was dealing, Schultz&rsquo;s friend at that.&nbsp; Lyte 
knew then that he was up against three of a kind.&nbsp; Now what 
did he do?&nbsp; What would you have done?&nbsp; Drawn three 
cards and held up the kings, of course.&nbsp; Not Lyte.&nbsp; He 
was playing optimism.&nbsp; He threw the kings away, held up the 
three little clubs, and drew two cards.&nbsp; He never looked at 
them.&nbsp; He looked across at Schultz to bet, and Schultz did 
bet, big.&nbsp; Since he himself held three aces he knew he had 
Lyte, because he played Lyte for threes, and, necessarily, they 
would have to be smaller threes.&nbsp; Poor Schultz!&nbsp; He was
perfectly correct under the premises.&nbsp; His mistake was that 
he thought Lyte was playing poker.&nbsp; They bet back and forth 
for five minutes, until Schultz&rsquo;s certainty began to ooze 
out.&nbsp; And all the time Lyte had never looked at his two 
cards, and Schultz knew it.&nbsp; I could see Schultz think, and 
revive, and splurge with his bets again.&nbsp; But the strain was
too much for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hold on, Gregory,&rsquo; he said at last.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got you beaten from the start.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t want any of your money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
got&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind what you&rsquo;ve got,&rsquo; Lyte 
interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve 
got.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ll take a look.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked, and raised the German a hundred 
dollars.&nbsp; Then they went at it again, back and forth and 
back and forth, until Schultz weakened and called, and laid down 
his three aces.&nbsp; Lyte faced his five cards.&nbsp; They were 
all black.&nbsp; He had drawn two more clubs.&nbsp; Do you know, 
he just about broke Schultz&rsquo;s nerve as a poker 
player.&nbsp; He never played in the same form again.&nbsp; He 
lacked confidence after that, and was a bit wobbly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But how could you do it?&rsquo; I asked Lyte 
afterwards.&nbsp; &lsquo;You knew he had you beaten when he drew 
two cards.&nbsp; Besides, you never looked at your own 
draw.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t have to look,&rsquo; was 
Lyte&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew they were two clubs all 
the time.&nbsp; They just had to be two clubs.&nbsp; Do you think
I was going to let that big Dutchman beat me?&nbsp; It was 
impossible that he should beat me.&nbsp; It is not my way to be 
beaten.&nbsp; I just have to win.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;d have been 
the most surprised man in this world if they hadn&rsquo;t been 
all clubs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Lyte&rsquo;s way, and maybe it will help you 
to appreciate his colossal optimism.&nbsp; As he put it he just 
had to succeed, to fare well, to prosper.&nbsp; And in that same 
incident, as in ten thousand others, he found his sanction.&nbsp;
The thing was that he did succeed, did prosper.&nbsp; That was 
why he was afraid of nothing.&nbsp; Nothing could ever happen to 
him.&nbsp; He knew it, because nothing had ever happened to 
him.&nbsp; That time the <i>Luga</i> was lost and he swam thirty 
miles, he was in the water two whole nights and a day.&nbsp; And 
during all that terrible stretch of time he never lost hope once,
never once doubted the outcome.&nbsp; He just knew he was going 
to make the land.&nbsp; He told me so himself, and I know it was 
the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is the kind of a man Lyte Gregory was.&nbsp;
He was of a different race from ordinary, ailing mortals.&nbsp; 
He was a lordly being, untouched by common ills and 
misfortunes.&nbsp; Whatever he wanted he got.&nbsp; He won his 
wife&mdash;one of the Caruthers, a little beauty&mdash;from a 
dozen rivals.&nbsp; And she settled down and made him the finest 
wife in the world.&nbsp; He wanted a boy.&nbsp; He got it.&nbsp; 
He wanted a girl and another boy.&nbsp; He got them.&nbsp; And 
they were just right, without spot or blemish, with chests like 
little barrels, and with all the inheritance of his own health 
and strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then it happened.&nbsp; The mark of the beast was 
laid upon him.&nbsp; I watched it for a year.&nbsp; It broke my 
heart.&nbsp; But he did not know it, nor did anybody else guess 
it except that cursed <i>hapa-haole</i>, Stephen Kaluna.&nbsp; He
knew it, but I did not know that he did.&nbsp; 
And&mdash;yes&mdash;Doc Strowbridge knew it.&nbsp; He was the 
federal physician, and he had developed the leper eye.&nbsp; You 
see, part of his business was to examine suspects and order them 
to the receiving station at Honolulu.&nbsp; And Stephen Kaluna 
had developed the leper eye.&nbsp; The disease ran strong in his 
family, and four or five of his relatives were already on 
Molokai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble arose over Stephen Kaluna&rsquo;s 
sister.&nbsp; When she became suspect, and before Doc Strowbridge
could get hold of her, her brother spirited her away to some 
hiding-place.&nbsp; Lyte was Sheriff of Kona, and it was his 
business to find her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were all over at Hilo that night, in Ned 
Austin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Stephen Kaluna was there when we came in, 
by himself, in his cups, and quarrelsome.&nbsp; Lyte was laughing
over some joke&mdash;that huge, happy laugh of a giant boy.&nbsp;
Kaluna spat contemptuously on the floor.&nbsp; Lyte noticed, so 
did everybody; but he ignored the fellow.&nbsp; Kaluna was 
looking for trouble.&nbsp; He took it as a personal grudge that 
Lyte was trying to apprehend his sister.&nbsp; In half a dozen 
ways he advertised his displeasure at Lyte&rsquo;s presence, but 
Lyte ignored him.&nbsp; I imagined Lyte was a bit sorry for him, 
for the hardest duty of his office was the apprehension of 
lepers.&nbsp; It is not a nice thing to go in to a man&rsquo;s 
house and tear away a father, mother, or child, who has done no 
wrong, and to send such a one to perpetual banishment on 
Molokai.&nbsp; Of course, it is necessary as a protection to 
society, and Lyte, I do believe, would have been the first to 
apprehend his own father did he become suspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, Kaluna blurted out:&nbsp; &lsquo;Look here, 
Gregory, you think you&rsquo;re going to find Kalaniweo, but 
you&rsquo;re not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalaniweo was his sister.&nbsp; Lyte glanced at him 
when his name was called, but he made no answer.&nbsp; Kaluna was
furious.&nbsp; He was working himself up all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing,&rsquo; he 
shouted.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be on Molokai yourself before 
ever you get Kalaniweo there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what you 
are.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no right to be in the company of honest 
men.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve made a terrible fuss talking about your 
duty, haven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve sent many lepers to 
Molokai, and knowing all the time you belonged there 
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d seen Lyte angry more than once, but never 
quite so angry as at that moment.&nbsp; Leprosy with us, you 
know, is not a thing to jest about.&nbsp; He made one leap across
the floor, dragging Kaluna out of his chair with a clutch on his 
neck.&nbsp; He shook him back and forth savagely, till you could 
hear the half-caste&rsquo;s teeth rattling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; Lyte was 
demanding.&nbsp; &lsquo;Spit it out, man, or I&rsquo;ll choke it 
out of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, in the West there is a certain phrase that a 
man must smile while uttering.&nbsp; So with us of the islands, 
only our phrase is related to leprosy.&nbsp; No matter what 
Kaluna was, he was no coward.&nbsp; As soon as Lyte eased the 
grip on his throat he answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean.&nbsp; You are a
leper yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyte suddenly flung the half-caste sideways into a 
chair, letting him down easily enough.&nbsp; Then Lyte broke out 
into honest, hearty laughter.&nbsp; But he laughed alone, and 
when he discovered it he looked around at our faces.&nbsp; I had 
reached his side and was trying to get him to come away, but he 
took no notice of me.&nbsp; He was gazing, fascinated, at Kaluna,
who was brushing at his own throat in a flurried, nervous way, as
if to brush off the contamination of the fingers that had 
clutched him.&nbsp; The action was unreasoned, genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyte looked around at us, slowly passing from face to 
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My God, fellows!&nbsp; My God!&rsquo; he 
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not speak it.&nbsp; It was more a hoarse whisper
of fright and horror.&nbsp; It was fear that fluttered in his 
throat, and I don&rsquo;t think that ever in his life before he 
had known fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then his colossal optimism asserted itself, and he 
laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A good joke&mdash;whoever put it up,&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;The drinks are on me.&nbsp; I had a scare for 
a moment.&nbsp; But, fellows, don&rsquo;t do it again, to 
anybody.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too serious.&nbsp; I tell you I died a 
thousand deaths in that moment.&nbsp; I thought of my wife and 
the kids, and . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His voice broke, and the half-caste, still 
throat-brushing, drew his eyes.&nbsp; He was puzzled and 
worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;John,&rsquo; he said, turning toward me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His jovial, rotund voice rang in my ears.&nbsp; But I 
could not answer.&nbsp; I was swallowing hard at that moment, and
besides, I knew my face didn&rsquo;t look just right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;John,&rsquo; he called again, taking a step 
nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He called timidly, and of all nightmares of horrors the
most frightful was to hear timidity in Lyte Gregory&rsquo;s 
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;John, John, what does it mean?&rsquo; he went 
on, still more timidly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a joke, isn&rsquo;t 
it?&nbsp; John, here&rsquo;s my hand.&nbsp; If I were a leper 
would I offer you my hand?&nbsp; Am I a leper, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He held out his hand, and what in high heaven or hell 
did I care?&nbsp; He was my friend.&nbsp; I took his hand, though
it cut me to the heart to see the way his face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was only a joke, Lyte,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We fixed it up on you.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s too serious.&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t do it 
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not laugh this time.&nbsp; He smiled, as a man 
awakened from a bad dream and still oppressed by the substance of
the dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, then,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do it again, and I&rsquo;ll stand for the 
drinks.&nbsp; But I may as well confess that you fellows had me 
going south for a moment.&nbsp; Look at the way I&rsquo;ve been 
sweating.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sighed and wiped the sweat from his forehead as he 
started to step toward the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is no joke,&rsquo; Kaluna said 
abruptly.&nbsp; I looked murder at him, and I felt murder, 
too.&nbsp; But I dared not speak or strike.&nbsp; That would have
precipitated the catastrophe which I somehow had a mad hope of 
still averting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is no joke,&rsquo; Kaluna repeated.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You are a leper, Lyte Gregory, and you&rsquo;ve no right 
putting your hands on honest men&rsquo;s flesh&mdash;on the clean
flesh of honest men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Gregory flared up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The joke has gone far enough!&nbsp; Quit 
it!&nbsp; Quit it, I say, Kaluna, or I&rsquo;ll give you a 
beating!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You undergo a bacteriological 
examination,&rsquo; Kaluna answered, &lsquo;and then you can beat
me&mdash;to death, if you want to.&nbsp; Why, man, look at 
yourself there in the glass.&nbsp; You can see it.&nbsp; Anybody 
can see it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re developing the lion face.&nbsp; 
See where the skin is darkened there over your eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyte peered and peered, and I saw his hands 
trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can see nothing,&rsquo; he said finally, then 
turned on the <i>hapa-haole</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have a black 
heart, Kaluna.&nbsp; And I am not ashamed to say that you have 
given me a scare that no man has a right to give another.&nbsp; I
take you at your word.&nbsp; I am going to settle this thing 
now.&nbsp; I am going straight to Doc Strowbridge.&nbsp; And when
I come back, watch out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never looked at us, but started for the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You wait here, John,&rsquo; he said, waving me 
back from accompanying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stood around like a group of ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is the truth,&rsquo; Kaluna said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You could see it for yourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They looked at me, and I nodded.&nbsp; Harry Burnley 
lifted his glass to his lips, but lowered it untasted.&nbsp; He 
spilled half of it over the bar.&nbsp; His lips were trembling 
like a child that is about to cry.&nbsp; Ned Austin made a 
clatter in the ice-chest.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t looking for 
anything.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he knew what he was 
doing.&nbsp; Nobody spoke.&nbsp; Harry Burnley&rsquo;s lips were 
trembling harder than ever.&nbsp; Suddenly, with a most horrible,
malignant expression he drove his fist into Kaluna&rsquo;s 
face.&nbsp; He followed it up.&nbsp; We made no attempt to 
separate them.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t care if he killed the 
half-caste.&nbsp; It was a terrible beating.&nbsp; We 
weren&rsquo;t interested.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even remember when 
Burnley ceased and let the poor devil crawl away.&nbsp; We were 
all too dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc Strowbridge told me about it afterward.&nbsp; He 
was working late over a report when Lyte came into his 
office.&nbsp; Lyte had already recovered his optimism, and came 
swinging in, a trifle angry with Kaluna to be sure, but very 
certain of himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;What could I do?&rsquo; Doc 
asked me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew he had it.&nbsp; I had seen it 
coming on for months.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t answer him.&nbsp; I 
couldn&rsquo;t say yes.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind telling you I 
broke down and cried.&nbsp; He pleaded for the bacteriological 
test.&nbsp; &lsquo;Snip out a piece, Doc,&rsquo; he said, over 
and over.&nbsp; &lsquo;Snip out a piece of skin and make the 
test.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way Doc Strowbridge cried must have convinced 
Lyte.&nbsp; The <i>Claudine</i> was leaving next morning for 
Honolulu.&nbsp; We caught him when he was going aboard.&nbsp; You
see, he was headed for Honolulu to give himself up to the Board 
of Health.&nbsp; We could do nothing with him.&nbsp; He had sent 
too many to Molokai to hang back himself.&nbsp; We argued for 
Japan.&nbsp; But he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to take my medicine, fellows,&rsquo; was 
all he would say, and he said it over and over.&nbsp; He was 
obsessed with the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wound up all his affairs from the Receiving Station 
at Honolulu, and went down to Molokai.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t get 
on well there.&nbsp; The resident physician wrote us that he was 
a shadow of his old self.&nbsp; You see he was grieving about his
wife and the kids.&nbsp; He knew we were taking care of them, but
it hurt him just the same.&nbsp; After six months or so I went 
down to Molokai.&nbsp; I sat on one side a plate-glass window, 
and he on the other.&nbsp; We looked at each other through the 
glass and talked through what might be called a speaking 
tube.&nbsp; But it was hopeless.&nbsp; He had made up his mind to
remain.&nbsp; Four mortal hours I argued.&nbsp; I was exhausted 
at the end.&nbsp; My steamer was whistling for me, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t stand for it.&nbsp; Three months 
later we chartered the schooner <i>Halcyon</i>.&nbsp; She was an 
opium smuggler, and she sailed like a witch.&nbsp; Her master was
a squarehead who would do anything for money, and we made a 
charter to China worth his while.&nbsp; He sailed from San 
Francisco, and a few days later we took out Landhouse&rsquo;s 
sloop for a cruise.&nbsp; She was only a five-ton yacht, but we 
slammed her fifty miles to windward into the north-east 
trade.&nbsp; Seasick?&nbsp; I never suffered so in my life.&nbsp;
Out of sight of land we picked up the <i>Halcyon</i>, and Burnley
and I went aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ran down to Molokai, arriving about eleven at 
night.&nbsp; The schooner hove to and we landed through the surf 
in a whale-boat at Kalawao&mdash;the place, you know, where 
Father Damien died.&nbsp; That squarehead was game.&nbsp; With a 
couple of revolvers strapped on him he came right along.&nbsp; 
The three of us crossed the peninsula to Kalaupapa, something 
like two miles.&nbsp; Just imagine hunting in the dead of night 
for a man in a settlement of over a thousand lepers.&nbsp; You 
see, if the alarm was given, it was all off with us.&nbsp; It was
strange ground, and pitch dark.&nbsp; The leper&rsquo;s dogs came
out and bayed at us, and we stumbled around till we got lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The squarehead solved it.&nbsp; He led the way into the
first detached house.&nbsp; We shut the door after us and struck 
a light.&nbsp; There were six lepers.&nbsp; We routed them up, 
and I talked in native.&nbsp; What I wanted was a 
<i>kokua</i>.&nbsp; A <i>kokua</i> is, literally, a helper, a 
native who is clean that lives in the settlement and is paid by 
the Board of Health to nurse the lepers, dress their sores, and 
such things.&nbsp; We stayed in the house to keep track of the 
inmates, while the squarehead led one of them off to find a 
<i>kokua</i>.&nbsp; He got him, and he brought him along at the 
point of his revolver.&nbsp; But the <i>kokua</i> was all 
right.&nbsp; While the squarehead guarded the house, Burnley and 
I were guided by the <i>kokua</i> to Lyte&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He
was all alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought you fellows would come,&rsquo; Lyte 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me, John.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s 
Ned, and Charley, and all the crowd?&nbsp; Never mind, tell me 
afterward.&nbsp; I am ready to go now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had nine 
months of it.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the boat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started back for the other house to pick up the 
squarehead.&nbsp; But the alarm had got out.&nbsp; Lights were 
showing in the houses, and doors were slamming.&nbsp; We had 
agreed that there was to be no shooting unless absolutely 
necessary, and when we were halted we went at it with our fists 
and the butts of our revolvers.&nbsp; I found myself tangled up 
with a big man.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t keep him off me, though 
twice I smashed him fairly in the face with my fist.&nbsp; He 
grappled with me, and we went down, rolling and scrambling and 
struggling for grips.&nbsp; He was getting away with me, when 
some one came running up with a lantern.&nbsp; Then I saw his 
face.&nbsp; How shall I describe the horror of it.&nbsp; It was 
not a face&mdash;only wasted or wasting features&mdash;a living 
ravage, noseless, lipless, with one ear swollen and distorted, 
hanging down to the shoulder.&nbsp; I was frantic.&nbsp; In a 
clinch he hugged me close to him until that ear flapped in my 
face.&nbsp; Then I guess I went insane.&nbsp; It was too 
terrible.&nbsp; I began striking him with my revolver.&nbsp; How 
it happened I don&rsquo;t know, but just as I was getting clear 
he fastened upon me with his teeth.&nbsp; The whole side of my 
hand was in that lipless mouth.&nbsp; Then I struck him with the 
revolver butt squarely between the eyes, and his teeth 
relaxed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cudworth held his hand to me in the moonlight, and I could see
the scars.&nbsp; It looked as if it had been mangled by a 
dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was.&nbsp; Seven years I waited.&nbsp; You know, it 
takes that long for the disease to incubate.&nbsp; Here in Kona I
waited, and it did not come.&nbsp; But there was never a day of 
those seven years, and never a night, that I did not look out on 
. . . on all this . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; His voice broke as he swept
his eyes from the moon-bathed sea beneath to the snowy summits 
above.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not bear to think of losing it, of 
never again beholding Kona.&nbsp; Seven years!&nbsp; I stayed 
clean.&nbsp; But that is why I am single.&nbsp; I was 
engaged.&nbsp; I could not dare to marry while I was in 
doubt.&nbsp; She did not understand.&nbsp; She went away to the 
States and married.&nbsp; I have never seen her since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at the moment I got clear of the leper policeman 
there was a rush and clatter of hoofs like a cavalry 
charge.&nbsp; It was the squarehead.&nbsp; He had been afraid of 
a rumpus and he had improved his time by making those blessed 
lepers he was guarding saddle up four horses.&nbsp; We were ready
for him.&nbsp; Lyte had accounted for three <i>kokuas</i>, and 
between us we untangled Burnley from a couple more.&nbsp; The 
whole settlement was in an uproar by that time, and as we dashed 
away somebody opened upon us with a Winchester.&nbsp; It must 
have been Jack McVeigh, the superintendent of Molokai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a ride!&nbsp; Leper horses, leper saddles, 
leper bridles, pitch-black darkness, whistling bullets, and a 
road none of the best.&nbsp; And the squarehead&rsquo;s horse was
a mule, and he didn&rsquo;t know how to ride, either.&nbsp; But 
we made the whaleboat, and as we shoved off through the surf we 
could hear the horses coming down the hill from Kalaupapa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to Shanghai.&nbsp; You look Lyte 
Gregory up.&nbsp; He is employed in a German firm there.&nbsp; 
Take him out to dinner.&nbsp; Open up wine.&nbsp; Give him 
everything of the best, but don&rsquo;t let him pay for 
anything.&nbsp; Send the bill to me.&nbsp; His wife and the kids 
are in Honolulu, and he needs the money for them.&nbsp; I 
know.&nbsp; He sends most of his salary, and lives like an 
anchorite.&nbsp; And tell him about Kona.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s 
where his heart is.&nbsp; Tell him all you can about 
Kona.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>JACK LONDON BY HIMSELF</h2>
<p>I was born in San Francisco in 1876.&nbsp; At fifteen I was a 
man among men, and if I had a spare nickel I spent it on beer 
instead of candy, because I thought it was more manly to buy 
beer.&nbsp; Now, when my years are nearly doubled, I am out on a 
hunt for the boyhood which I never had, and I am less serious 
than at any other time of my life.&nbsp; Guess I&rsquo;ll find 
that boyhood!&nbsp; Almost the first things I realized were 
responsibilities.&nbsp; I have no recollection of being taught to
read or write&mdash;I could do both at the age of five&mdash;but 
I know that my first school was in Alameda before I went out on a
ranch with my folks and as a ranch boy worked hard from my eighth
year.</p>
<p>The second school were I tried to pick up a little learning 
was an irregular hit or miss affair at San Mateo.&nbsp; Each 
class sat in a separate desk, but there were days when we did not
sit at all, for the master used to get drunk very often, and then
one of the elder boys would thrash him.&nbsp; To even things up, 
the master would then thrash the younger lads, so you can think 
what sort of school it was.&nbsp; There was no one belonging to 
me, or associated with me in any way, who had literary tastes or 
ideas, the nearest I can make to it is that my great-grandfather 
was a circuit writer, a Welshman, known as &ldquo;Priest&rdquo; 
Jones in the backwoods, where his enthusiasm led him to scatter 
the Gospel.</p>
<p>One of my earliest and strongest impressions was of the 
ignorance of other people.&nbsp; I had read and absorbed 
Washington Irving&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alhambra&rdquo; before I was 
nine, but could never understand how it was that the other 
ranchers knew nothing about it.&nbsp; Later I concluded that this
ignorance was peculiar to the country, and felt that those who 
lived in cities would not be so dense.&nbsp; One day a man from 
the city came to the ranch.&nbsp; He wore shiny shoes and a cloth
coat, and I felt that here was a good chance for me to exchange 
thoughts with an enlightened mind.&nbsp; From the bricks of an 
old fallen chimney I had built an Alhambra of my own; towers, 
terraces, and all were complete, and chalk inscriptions marked 
the different sections.&nbsp; Here I led the city man and 
questioned him about &ldquo;The Alhambra,&rdquo; but he was as 
ignorant as the man on the ranch, and then I consoled myself with
the thought that there were only two clever people in the 
world&mdash;Washington Irving and myself.</p>
<p>My other reading-matter at that time consisted mainly of dime 
novels, borrowed from the hired men, and newspapers in which the 
servants gloated over the adventures of poor but virtuous 
shop-girls.</p>
<p>Through reading such stuff my mind was necessarily 
ridiculously conventional, but being very lonely I read 
everything that came my way, and was greatly impressed by 
Ouida&rsquo;s story &ldquo;Signa,&rdquo; which I devoured 
regularly for a couple of years.&nbsp; I never knew the finish 
until I grew up, for the closing chapters were missing from my 
copy, so I kept on dreaming with the hero, and, like him, unable 
to see Nemesis, at the end.&nbsp; My work on the ranch at one 
time was to watch the bees, and as I sat under a tree from 
sunrise till late in the afternoon, waiting for the swarming, I 
had plenty of time to read and dream.&nbsp; Livermore Valley was 
very flat, and even the hills around were then to me devoid of 
interest, and the only incident to break in on my visions was 
when I gave the alarm of swarming, and the ranch folks rushed out
with pots, pans, and buckets of water.&nbsp; I think the opening 
line of &ldquo;Signa&rdquo; was &ldquo;It was only a little 
lad,&rdquo; yet he had dreams of becoming a great musician, and 
having all Europe at his feet.&nbsp; Well, I was only a little 
lad, too, but why could not I become what &ldquo;Signa&rdquo; 
dreamed of being?</p>
<p>Life on a Californian ranch was then to me the dullest 
possible existence, and every day I thought of going out beyond 
the sky-line to see the world.&nbsp; Even then there were 
whispers, promptings; my mind inclined to things beautiful, 
although my environment was unbeautiful.&nbsp; The hills and 
valleys around were eyesores and aching pits, and I never loved 
them till I left them.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Before I was eleven I left the ranch and came to Oakland, 
where I spent so much of my time in the Free Public Library, 
eagerly reading everything that came to hand, that I developed 
the first stages of St. Vitus&rsquo; dance from lack of 
exercise.&nbsp; Disillusions quickly followed, as I learned more 
of the world.&nbsp; At this time I made my living as a newsboy, 
selling papers in the streets; and from then on until I was 
sixteen I had a thousand and one different occupations&mdash;work
and school, school and work&mdash;and so it ran.</p>
<p>Then the adventure-lust was strong within me, and I left 
home.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t run, I just left&mdash;went out in the
bay, and joined the oyster pirates.&nbsp; The days of the oyster 
pirates are now past, and if I had got my dues for piracy, I 
would have been given five hundred years in prison.&nbsp; Later, 
I shipped as a sailor on a schooner, and also took a turn at 
salmon fishing.&nbsp; Oddly enough, my next occupation was on a 
fish-patrol, where I was entrusted with the arrest of any 
violators of the fishing laws.&nbsp; Numbers of lawless Chinese, 
Greeks, and Italians were at that time engaged in illegal 
fishing, and many a patrolman paid his life for his 
interference.&nbsp; My only weapon on duty was a steel 
table-fork, but I felt fearless and a man when I climbed over the
side of a boat to arrest some marauder.</p>
<p>Subsequently I shipped before the mast and sailed for the 
Japanese coast on a seal-hunting expedition, later going to 
Behring Sea.&nbsp; After sealing for seven months I came back to 
California and took odd jobs at coal shovelling and longshoring 
and also in a jute factory, where I worked from six in the 
morning until seven at night.&nbsp; I had planned to join the 
same lot for another sealing trip the following year, but somehow
I missed them.&nbsp; They sailed away on the <i>Mary Thomas</i>, 
which was lost with all hands.</p>
<p>In my fitful school-days I had written the usual compositions,
which had been praised in the usual way, and while working in the
jute mills I still made an occasional try.&nbsp; The factory 
occupied thirteen hours of my day, and being young and husky, I 
wanted a little time for myself, so there was little left for 
composition.&nbsp; The San Francisco <i>Call</i> offered a prize 
for a descriptive article.&nbsp; My mother urged me to try for 
it, and I did, taking for my subject &ldquo;Typhoon off the Coast
of Japan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very tired and sleepy, knowing I had to be
up at half-past five, I began the article at midnight and worked 
straight on until I had written two thousand words, the limit of 
the article, but with my idea only half worked out.&nbsp; The 
next night, under the same conditions, I continued, adding 
another two thousand words before I finished, and then the third 
night I spent in cutting out the excess, so as to bring the 
article within the conditions of the contest.&nbsp; The first 
prize came to me, and the second and third went to students of 
the Stanford and Berkeley Universities.</p>
<p>My success in the San Francisco <i>Call</i> competition 
seriously turned my thoughts to writing, but my blood was still 
too hot for a settled routine, so I practically deferred 
literature, beyond writing a little gush for the <i>Call</i>, 
which that journal promptly rejected.</p>
<p>I tramped all through the United States, from California to 
Boston, and up and down, returning to the Pacific coast by way of
Canada, where I got into jail and served a term for vagrancy, and
the whole tramping experience made me become a Socialist.&nbsp; 
Previously I had been impressed by the dignity of labour, and, 
without having read Carlyle or Kipling, I had formulated a gospel
of work which put theirs in the shade.&nbsp; Work was 
everything.&nbsp; It was sanctification and salvation.&nbsp; The 
pride I took in a hard day&rsquo;s work well done would be 
inconceivable to you.&nbsp; I was as faithful a wage-slave as 
ever a capitalist exploited.&nbsp; In short, my joyous 
individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois 
ethics.&nbsp; I had fought my way from the open west, where men 
bucked big and the job hunted the man, to the congested labour 
centres of the eastern states, where men were small potatoes and 
hunted the job for all they were worth, and I found myself 
looking upon life from a new and totally different angle.&nbsp; I
saw the workers in the shambles at the bottom of the Social 
Pit.&nbsp; I swore I would never again do a hard day&rsquo;s work
with my body except where absolutely compelled to, and I have 
been busy ever since running away from hard bodily labour.</p>
<p>In my nineteenth year I returned to Oakland and started at the
High School, which ran the usual school magazine.&nbsp; This 
publication was a weekly&mdash;no, I guess a monthly&mdash;one, 
and I wrote stories for it, very little imaginary, just recitals 
of my sea and tramping experiences.&nbsp; I remained there a 
year, doing janitor work as a means of livelihood, and leaving 
eventually because the strain was more than I could bear.&nbsp; 
At this time my socialistic utterances had attracted considerable
attention, and I was known as the &ldquo;Boy Socialist,&rdquo; a 
distinction that brought about my arrest for 
street-talking.&nbsp; After leaving the High School, in three 
months cramming by myself, I took the three years&rsquo; work for
that time and entered the University of California.&nbsp; I hated
to give up the hope of a University education and worked in a 
laundry and with my pen to help me keep on.&nbsp; This was the 
only time I worked because I loved it, but the task was too much,
and when half-way through my Freshman year I had to quit.</p>
<p>I worked away ironing shirts and other things in the laundry, 
and wrote in all my spare time.&nbsp; I tried to keep on at both,
but often fell asleep with the pen in my hand.&nbsp; Then I left 
the laundry and wrote all the time, and lived and dreamed 
again.&nbsp; After three months&rsquo; trial I gave up writing, 
having decided that I was a failure, and left for the Klondike to
prospect for gold.&nbsp; At the end of the year, owing to the 
outbreak of scurvy, I was compelled to come out, and on the 
homeward journey of 1,900 miles in an open boat made the only 
notes of the trip.&nbsp; It was in the Klondike I found 
myself.&nbsp; There nobody talks.&nbsp; Everybody thinks.&nbsp; 
You get your true perspective.&nbsp; I got mine.</p>
<p>While I was in the Klondike my father died, and the burden of 
the family fell on my shoulders.&nbsp; Times were bad in 
California, and I could get no work.&nbsp; While trying for it I 
wrote &ldquo;Down the River,&rdquo; which was rejected.&nbsp; 
During the wait for this rejection I wrote a twenty-thousand word
serial for a news company, which was also rejected.&nbsp; Pending
each rejection I still kept on writing fresh stuff.&nbsp; I did 
not know what an editor looked like.&nbsp; I did not know a soul 
who had ever published anything.&nbsp; Finally a story was 
accepted by a Californian magazine, for which I received five 
dollars.&nbsp; Soon afterwards &ldquo;The Black Cat&rdquo; 
offered me forty dollars for a story.</p>
<p>Then things took a turn, and I shall probably not have to 
shovel coal for a living for some time to come, although I have 
done it, and could do it again.</p>
<p>My first book was published in 1900.&nbsp; I could have made a
good deal at newspaper work; but I had sufficient sense to refuse
to be a slave to that man-killing machine, for such I held a 
newspaper to be to a young man in his forming period.&nbsp; Not 
until I was well on my feet as a magazine-writer did I do much 
work for newspapers.&nbsp; I am a believer in regular work, and 
never wait for an inspiration.&nbsp; Temperamentally I am not 
only careless and irregular, but melancholy; still I have fought 
both down.&nbsp; The discipline I had as a sailor had full effect
on me.&nbsp; Perhaps my old sea days are also responsible for the
regularity and limitations of my sleep.&nbsp; Five and a half 
hours is the precise average I allow myself, and no circumstance 
has yet arisen in my life that could keep me awake when the time 
comes to &ldquo;turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am very fond of sport, and delight in boxing, fencing, 
swimming, riding, yachting, and even kite-flying.&nbsp; Although 
primarily of the city, I like to be near it rather than in 
it.&nbsp; The country, though, is the best, the only natural 
life.&nbsp; In my grown-up years the writers who have influenced 
me most are Karl Marx in a particular, and Spencer in a general, 
way.&nbsp; In the days of my barren boyhood, if I had had a 
chance, I would have gone in for music; now, in what are more 
genuinely the days of my youth, if I had a million or two I would
devote myself to writing poetry and pamphlets.&nbsp; I think the 
best work I have done is in the &ldquo;League of the Old 
Men,&rdquo; and parts of &ldquo;The Kempton-Wace 
Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other people don&rsquo;t like the 
former.&nbsp; They prefer brighter and more cheerful 
things.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall feel like that, too, when the days 
of my youth are behind me.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
